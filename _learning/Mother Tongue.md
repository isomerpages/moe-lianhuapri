# Mother Tongue

**Vision**

Lianhua Mother Tongue Department aims to cultivate confident and effective communicators in using MTL so that the students can connect with wider communities across Asia and the world. We also aim to cultivate appreciation of our different cultures to strengthen our multicultural identity and prepare them to be a lifelong learner.

**Mission**

To ignite the passion in learning Mother Tongue Language and appreciation of the culture, we engage students through interesting stories from the syllabus, picture books and various programs. We develop their language skills and 21st century skills by providing different platforms for them to showcase.

## Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme

The aims of Conversational CL/ML programme are two-fold: to strengthen Singapore’s multiracial compact and to enable Singaporeans to have some grounding of functional CL/ML so that they could more easily pick up the language should they need it for economic or other reasons in adult life.

When Lianhua was first introduced to CCM in 2006, we engage vendors to conduct the programme. A few years ago, we decided to infuse CCM into various celebrations or commemorations so that students can apply their learning in an authentic setting.


For instance during Racial Harmony Day, we have different learning packages for different levels to engage them in learning the vocabulary using CL/ML. Then they will put these vocabularies into sentence structures given to form a paragraph. They will present to the class during CCE lessons.

## Celebrations

In Singapore, a festive celebration means more than just a public holiday, it also means that people from different races are able to witness the celebrating community’s rites and rituals, and join in the celebration.

In Lianhua, we celebrated the Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali every year. Students of different ethnic groups will participate in the pre-celebration activities like designing wishing cards, experiencing cultural activities during recess and learning how to wish their teachers, peers or canteen vendors using the language of the ethnic group who are celebrating the festival.

On the actual day, students get to view the concert that brings out the traditions and customs of the festivals.

## MTL Fortnight

Mother Tongue Fortnight

The start of Term 2 is an exciting one, with Mother Tongue Fortnight activities engaging our students in their respective Mother Tongue Languages, and kindling their love for it.

In a speech by Mr Lee Kuan Yew on 6 Sep 2011, he highlighted the importance of Mother Tongues, stating "We kept our original languages by our policy of bilingualism, allowing opportunities for people to study their respective mother tongues. This built a sense of belonging to their original roots and increased their self-confidence and self-respect."


It is indeed essential for us to use our own MT language well, and stay rooted in our own culture, while embracing Singapore as a multicultural and multilingual society.

The Mother Tongue Fortnight, an MOE initiative since 2011, serves as an apt reminder, that on top of daily Mother Tongue Language lessons, there is so much more we can do with the language that speaks of our identity.

Like previous years, Mother Tongue Fortnight continues to have a wide range of activities in place for respective levels. Some activities include:

All Levels: Creative Writing Competition / Penmanship Competition / Reading with Parents / Language & Cultural Games/ Meet the author session and many others.  

P1 & P2: Poem Recitation & Singing    
P3 & P4: Little Tour Guide of Singapore   
P5 & P6: Advertisement
