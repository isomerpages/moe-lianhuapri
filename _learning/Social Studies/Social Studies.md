## **Social Studies in Lianhua Primary School**

The 2020 Social Studies curriculum seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. The Curriculum therefore envisions Social Studies students as informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.

The learning of Social Studies provides many opportunities for the achievement of the Desired Outcomes of Education, which are attributes that educators aspire for Singaporeans to have by the completion of their formal education.

For details on the Desired Outcomes of Education, please refer to the link below:

In Lianhua, the Social Studies curriculum envisions students to have joy in learning Social Studies, through inquiry and meaningful authentic learning experiences. Through these experiences, we envision that students will develop into informed, concerned and participative citizens with the passion to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.

<b> **Learning Journeys** </b>

The Learning Journeys initiative, which is an annual programme in Lianhua Primary School aims to support and complement the Social Studies curriculum. The school has collaborated with participating organisations to make learning more authentic and experiential. Much thought was put in to ensure that the venues of the learning journeys tie in well with the syllabus that they are learning.

#### **Heritage Explorer Programme Booklet**

The school collaborated with the National Heritage Board in 2016 to introduce the Heritage Explorer Programme Booklet to raise students’ awareness and interest in local and community heritage, with the greater goal of enabling them to become informed, active and concerned citizens. Each student will be receiving a Heritage Explorer Booklet which requires them to complete a variety of heritage-related activities, exploring topics that can range from personal family histories to community and national history.

Starting in 2023, we have decided to administer this programme to the Primary 2, 3 and 5 as it is more relevant to what they are learning in the syllabus. Each level is assigned a profession (Curator, Designer and Educator) where they are required to complete at least 3 out of the 5 tasks given. Upon completion of the tasks, students will be awarded with a Heritage Explorers Badge. This programme allows our students to be more self-directed, which encourages proactive learning and helps to cultivate a sense of commitment and passion for the heritage.

Due to our commitment to the programme, the school has been awarded the School Heritage Champion Awards (Primary School) in 2019.

#### **Performance Tasks**

As part of the Primary School Social Studies Syllabus, performance tasks are used as part of the grading system for the assessment of SSP at the end of Semester 1 and 2 for all levels. Performance tasks are effective ways to check for students’ understanding of the concepts taught. These tasks introduced are relevant and meaningful to the students. Students would develop a tangible product or performance for an identified audience and in doing so, they would communicate key understanding(s) or message(s) pertaining to the topic of study. Examples of the performance tasks that are required for the students to produce are as follows:


| Level | Semester 1 | Semester 2  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| P1     | Create a video to share about their roles in school and at home     | Design their future neighbourhood     |
| P2     | Design a school stamp     | Create a diorama on their favourite sporting activity    |
| P3     | Design a poster on 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle)     | Design a 2D/3D model on the future housing of Singapore     |
| P4    | Create an informational poster on one of the early settlers they have learnt   | Design a digital story to share the contributions of a war hero     |
| P5    | Design a poster to honour the different people who had contributed to the building of Singapore’s defence     | Design a board game related to Southeast Asia     |
| P6    | Design an infographic featuring two innovations of the civilisations of the Indian subcontinent or the Chinese civilisation     | Create a PowerPoint presentation based on one of the UNESCO Heritage sites in Southeast Asia   |


#### **P4 Social Studies Heritage Tower Experience**

As part of the P4 Social Studies Curriculum, the Primary 4 students will be given the opportunity to explore the school’s heritage tower to allow them to learn more about the school’s history and appreciate the contributions made by the pioneers. This programme extends the students’ learning on the topic of “Early Settlers” where they will learn about the contributions made by the early settlers in areas of education and health.&nbsp;

Students will be involved in a series of lessons where they will have the chance to look for information at the heritage tower to answer a series of questions (e.g fill in the blanks, matching, scrambled words). This learning experience aims to allow students get to know more about the school and at the same time inculcating a sense of belonging and pride in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
