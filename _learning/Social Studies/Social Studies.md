### Social Studies in Lianhua Primary School


The 2020 Social Studies curriculum seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. The Curriculum therefore envisions Social Studies students as informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.

The learning of Social Studies provides many opportunities for the achievement of the Desired Outcomes of Education, which are attributes that educators aspire for Singaporeans to have by the completion of their formal education.

For details on the Desired Outcomes of Education, please refer to the link below:

In Lianhua, the Social Studies curriculum envisions students to have joy in learning Social Studies, through inquiry and meaningful authentic learning experiences. Through these experiences, we envision that students will develop into informed, concerned and participative citizens with the passion to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.

<h4><strong>Learning Journeys</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Museum Based Cohort Learning Journeys</strong><br>The Museum-Based Cohort Learning Journeys at Lianhua Primary School are an integral part of the annual Social Studies curriculum. This program is designed to enhance and support students' learning by providing them with authentic, real-world experiences that complement their classroom education. By immersing students in real-world settings, it allows them to contextualize their classroom learning, making concepts and content more tangible and relevant. This experiential learning approach not only deepens understanding but also motivates students to explore, construct new knowledge, and make meaningful connections to the topics they study.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school collaborates with carefully chosen organizations, fostering partnerships that are meticulously crafted to provide students with immersive, hands-on learning experiences. These collaborations ensure that the learning journeys are both authentic and enriching, allowing students to actively engage with the content in a meaningful and impactful way.</p>

<p>Each level participates in a unique museum-based Learning Journey:</p>

#### **Performance Tasks**

As part of the Primary School Social Studies Syllabus, performance tasks are used as part of the grading system for the assessment of SSP at the end of Semester 1 and 2 for all levels. Performance tasks are effective ways to check for students’ understanding of the concepts taught. These tasks introduced are relevant and meaningful to the students. Students would develop a tangible product or performance for an identified audience and in doing so, they would communicate key understanding(s) or message(s) pertaining to the topic of study. 


#### **P4 Social Studies Heritage Tower Experience**

As part of the P4 Social Studies Curriculum, the Primary 4 students will be given the opportunity to explore the school’s heritage tower to allow them to learn more about the school’s history and appreciate the contributions made by the pioneers. This programme extends the students’ learning on the topic of “Early Settlers” where they will learn about the contributions made by the early settlers in areas of education and health.&nbsp;

Students will be involved in a series of lessons where they will have the chance to look for information at the heritage tower to answer a series of questions (e.g fill in the blanks, matching, scrambled words). This learning experience aims to allow students get to know more about the school and at the same time inculcating a sense of belonging and pride in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
