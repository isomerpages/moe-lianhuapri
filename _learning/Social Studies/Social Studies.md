## Social Studies in Lianhua Primary School

The 2020 Social Studies curriculum seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.

In Lianhua, the Social Studies curriculum envisions students to have joy in learning Social Studies, through inquiry and meaningful authentic learning experiences. Through these experiences, we envision that students will develop into informed, concerned and participative citizens with the passion to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.

#### Learning Journeys

The Learning Journeys initiative, which is an annual programme in Lianhua Primary School aims to support and complement the Social Studies curriculum. The school has collaborated with participating organisations to make learning more authentic and experiential. Much thought was put in to ensure that the venues of the learning journeys tie in well with the syllabus that they are learning.

#### P2 On Site Learning Journey

As part of our yearly Social Studies Learning Journey Initiative, the Primary 2 students had an opportunity to be involved in an on-site learning journey programme by Singapore Philatelic Museum. This on-site programme provides students an opportunity to discover more about stamps and learn how stamps are miniature pieces of art that document the country's historical milestones, national achievements, inspirations and more. Despite the constraints of not being able to be at the museum, the students were able to have a first-hand experience using magnifying glass to observe and make meaning of what they see in the stamps. They also has a chance to design their own stamp and get to experience writing their own postcard to send home. It was truly an eye opening experience for them.
