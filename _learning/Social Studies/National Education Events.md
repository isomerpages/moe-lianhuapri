#### **Total Defence Day** 

Lianhua Primary School commemorates Total Defence Day (TDD) by reminding all staff and students that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we all have a part to play to defend Singapore.  

Many activities were organised to provide our students the opportunities to learn, think, communicate their thoughts and to lead themselves and others during emergencies. These are the students’ outcomes that the school has embarked on to create a generation of concerned and future-ready citizens.

<b>**Passionate Learners**</b>

Our TDD assembly programme featured a skit titled ‘Together We Defend’. The skit tells the story of a group of residents in a sacred forest at a time of crisis. They had to come together despite their differences to maintain the peace and harmony in the community. Students were able to resonate the pillars of total defence with the story in a fun and interactive manner.

<b>**Creative and Critical Thinkers**</b>

Our students went through class-based discussions during CCE (FTGP) lessons on authentic emergency scenarios such as a fire as well as an attack at the mall. Students had to think on their feet on how to respond to such crises based on the tips provided.

<b>**Confident Communicator**</b>

Recess activities were specially designed for the students to express their understanding of and attitude towards the pillars of total defence. There was a quiz station to test them on cyber securities, an idea generator station to help a hungry teddy bear, a workout station to be a healthy and fit citizen, and even a Photo Booth for friends to pose a photo of strength in unity. Our students really surprised us with their wonderful responses.

<b>**Exemplary Leaders**</b>

A surprise fire drill was conducted in the early Tuesday morning this week. The drill seemed so real that some students were seen crying during the fire evacuation. Staff and students were also seen supporting those who are emotionally affected. Everybody managed to evacuate safely within 11 minutes 35 seconds. At the end of the drill, everyone understood the importance of taking care of self and others in times of emergency. Everyone agreed that the school will try to evacuate within 10 minutes in the next fire drills.

#### International Friendship Day 2021

Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on Tuesday, 6th April, and the theme is&nbsp;**‘Singapore in the World’**&nbsp;. More than ever, Covid-19 has brought both challenges and opportunities for Singapore, and reminded us on the importance of international collaboration and cooperation. The changing global landscapes and the complexities of the world highlight the importance of maintaining good relationships and the needs for our youths to recognise the importance of connectedness within and beyond ASEAN.

Through learning more about the rich diversity of cultures, our students can develop the spirit of friendship and collaboration, and chart the way forward for Singapore to connect with different countries in the global community.

#### Racial Harmony Day 2021

The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on Tuesday, 13th July, and the theme of this year is&nbsp;**‘Common spaces, connected communities’**&nbsp;. The theme takes on special significance as we see racial harmony incidents and issues arising and being discussed in the public space. It is important to help our students apply the theme in their lives, to explore what it means to strengthen connection amongst communities, and to take action to preserve racial harmony in Singapore. We hope to guide our students to reflect on their shared experiences and values that have connected us as Singaporeans.

The school had planned a number of activities to commemorate RHD and we hope that through these activities, our students had learnt to be friends with their neighbours, build relationships with people of different races and celebrate our diversity as our strength.

#### National Day Celebrations 2021

The school celebrated National Day (ND) on Friday, 6th August. The theme of our celebration is&nbsp;**‘Together, Our Singapore Spirit’**&nbsp;. It evokes our common Singapore identity and Singaporeans coming together as one united people. It calls on Singaporeans to draw new strength from our ‘can-do’ spirit, amidst challenging circumstances from Covid-19 and potential disruptions in the new decade.

We hope our students to reinvigorate the Singapore Spirit- encouraging Singaporeans to embrace a ‘dare-to-try’ attitude and reinvent to overturn our natural and geographical constraints.
