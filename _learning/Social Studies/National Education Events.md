#### **INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY 2023**

Lianhua Primary School commenced the commemoration of the International Friendship Day (IFD) on Tuesday, 4 April 2023. The IFD commemoration lasted til 14 April 2023. In line with this year’s theme–‘Singapore in Asia’, IFD@LHPS conducted programmes which focused on our diverse and colourful cultural identities, through which our students could foster the spirit of friendship, cooperation, and connectedness.&nbsp;

**Passionate Learners**

The IFD assembly began with mass singing of our own self-composed friendship songs, “La Vita E Bella” and “Best of Friends”. Supported by the Music Department, a group of student volunteers led the school in the singing of the two beautiful friendship songs, which are available on YouTube. Everyone sang and jived to the music.

In the Special Live Edition of News in Brief, three of our budding Primary Two newscasters covered news of Singapore’s friendship with other nations through political, economic, social, and cultural cooperation within ASEAN and Asia. They also highlighted LHPS’ hosting of students and teachers from Sanpatong Suwannarat Wittayakarn School (SSWS) from the province of Thailand in February. To celebrate the newfound friendship between LHPS and SSWS, some of the Thai students presented their traditional dance titled, “The Umbrella Dance”, to the school via a pre-recorded video. This segment ended off with our young newscasters conducting an exciting quiz for the whole school.&nbsp;

The main highlight of the assembly would be the Fashion Parade by our little supermodels, featuring their traditional costumes. Our international students showcased their supermodel talents by catwalking on stage and shared about their traditional costumes with the school.

**Creative and Critical Thinker**

The commemoration of the IFD continued during the recesses, where the students enjoyed a range of fun-filled activities at the various booths set up and run by parent volunteers and teachers. There was an iPad quiz booth where the lower primary students had to guess the name of the ASEAN countries while the middle primary students had to guess the ASEAN capital cities. For the upper primary students, they had to guess countries based on given emojis.&nbsp; In the Art Room, students had to think creatively on how to design a national costume for the school’s teddy bear with elements of ASEAN in their designs. There was even a Photo Booth for our students to pose a photo with their international friends. The IFD@Recess provided an authentic and fun experience for our students.

**Confident Communicators**

The IFD@LHPS experiences were brought back to the classrooms when the teachers revisited the topic during CCE lessons such as the Social Studies lessons and the CCE (FTGP) lessons. The discussions during these lessons allowed our students the opportunity to share their thoughts on the importance of international friendship for Singapore and the role of ASEAN in ensuring the survival of Singapore. The students were then asked to relate what they have learnt to their daily lives.&nbsp;

**Exemplary Leaders**

The challenge for all of us now is to be exemplary ambassadors for Singapore, both as a host to the international students both amongst us, as well as to students on exchange programmes visiting our school. To achieve this, which school values do you think are essential for our students to learn?


#### **Total Defence Day**&nbsp;

Lianhua Primary School commemorates Total Defence Day (TDD) by reminding all staff and students that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we all have a part to play to defend Singapore.  

Many activities were organised to provide our students the opportunities to learn, think, communicate their thoughts and to lead themselves and others during emergencies. These are the students’ outcomes that the school has embarked on to create a generation of concerned and future-ready citizens.

<b>**Passionate Learners**</b>

Our TDD assembly programme featured a skit titled ‘Together We Defend’. The skit tells the story of a group of residents in a sacred forest at a time of crisis. They had to come together despite their differences to maintain the peace and harmony in the community. Students were able to resonate the pillars of total defence with the story in a fun and interactive manner.

<b>**Creative and Critical Thinkers**</b>

Our students went through class-based discussions during CCE (FTGP) lessons on authentic emergency scenarios such as a fire as well as an attack at the mall. Students had to think on their feet on how to respond to such crises based on the tips provided.

<b>**Confident Communicator**</b>

Recess activities were specially designed for the students to express their understanding of and attitude towards the pillars of total defence. There was a quiz station to test them on cyber securities, an idea generator station to help a hungry teddy bear, a workout station to be a healthy and fit citizen, and even a Photo Booth for friends to pose a photo of strength in unity. Our students really surprised us with their wonderful responses.

<b>**Exemplary Leaders**</b>

A surprise fire drill was conducted in the early Tuesday morning this week. The drill seemed so real that some students were seen crying during the fire evacuation. Staff and students were also seen supporting those who are emotionally affected. Everybody managed to evacuate safely within 11 minutes 35 seconds. At the end of the drill, everyone understood the importance of taking care of self and others in times of emergency. Everyone agreed that the school will try to evacuate within 10 minutes in the next fire drills.

#### **International Friendship Day 2021**

Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on Tuesday, 6th April, and the theme is&nbsp;**‘Singapore in the World’**&nbsp;. More than ever, Covid-19 has brought both challenges and opportunities for Singapore, and reminded us on the importance of international collaboration and cooperation. The changing global landscapes and the complexities of the world highlight the importance of maintaining good relationships and the needs for our youths to recognise the importance of connectedness within and beyond ASEAN.

Through learning more about the rich diversity of cultures, our students can develop the spirit of friendship and collaboration, and chart the way forward for Singapore to connect with different countries in the global community.

#### Racial Harmony Day 2021

The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on Tuesday, 13th July, and the theme of this year is&nbsp;**‘Common spaces, connected communities’**&nbsp;. The theme takes on special significance as we see racial harmony incidents and issues arising and being discussed in the public space. It is important to help our students apply the theme in their lives, to explore what it means to strengthen connection amongst communities, and to take action to preserve racial harmony in Singapore. We hope to guide our students to reflect on their shared experiences and values that have connected us as Singaporeans.

The school had planned a number of activities to commemorate RHD and we hope that through these activities, our students had learnt to be friends with their neighbours, build relationships with people of different races and celebrate our diversity as our strength.

#### National Day Celebrations 2021

The school celebrated National Day (ND) on Friday, 6th August. The theme of our celebration is&nbsp;**‘Together, Our Singapore Spirit’**&nbsp;. It evokes our common Singapore identity and Singaporeans coming together as one united people. It calls on Singaporeans to draw new strength from our ‘can-do’ spirit, amidst challenging circumstances from Covid-19 and potential disruptions in the new decade.

We hope our students to reinvigorate the Singapore Spirit- encouraging Singaporeans to embrace a ‘dare-to-try’ attitude and reinvent to overturn our natural and geographical constraints.
