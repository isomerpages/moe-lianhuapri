# **National Education Events**

#### **National Education**
National Education (NE) is a significant aspect of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) which comprises a wide range of school efforts that help students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore.

NE in CCE aims to be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making so as to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.
National Education comprises four core annual events which are Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.

#### **Racial Harmony Day 2023**

Lianhua Primary School commemorated Racial Harmony Day on Tuesday, 18th July 2023. The theme for this year is ‘Our Multicultural Mosaic’, which reflects how each community, while having the space to express its own identity as part of Singapore society, also intertwines with others to depict the unique cultural diversity that characterises Singapore life. Hence, as part of that theme, our students and teachers were encouraged to wear their traditional costumes to school for that day.

**Passionate Learners**

The session was kicked off by a mass singing session. Voices intertwined, filling the air as students and&nbsp; alike sang our school’s self-composed song, ‘Diversity’, and the classic song about Friendship, ‘The More We Get Together’, in our four national languages.&nbsp;

This was followed by a cultural fashion talk as seven Primary Three students shared about their traditional ethnic costumes. Next, a skit, titled “Singapore through my eyes” was performed. The skit showed us how our students’ sense of cultural identity was expressed in their daily lives, and it served to remind us that even in our diversity, much exists to unite us. In addition, as we progress towards the future together, to continue to be united, we will need to be culturally sensitive to such differences.&nbsp;

This was followed by a quiz segment to engage students and help them to better understand the importance of racial harmony in Singapore.&nbsp;

**Creative and Critical Thinkers**

The school buzzed with excitement as students immersed themselves in the variety of engaging activities planned for them.

Coincidentally, six students and two teachers from Xi’an Veritas School, China, were the special guests of the day, and they were invited to take part in the activities. It was truly an eye-opener for them as they immersed themselves in the festivities and games, which showcased the richness and diversity of Singapore’s cultural heritage.

The school grounds transformed into a cultural playground during recess as students enthusiastically engaged in traditional games and activities. The participants had to find ways and means to overcome different challenges such as keeping a feathered shuttlecock in the air as long as possibly by kicking it up with different parts of the body in the game of chapteh.&nbsp;

At another station, our students had to explore ways of picking up marbles using chopsticks, while at the photo booth, they were invited to commemorate the occasion by taking a photo with a friend or two.&nbsp;

Finally, at the Indian Cultural booth, they challenged their senses by guessing the types of Indian spices. Apart from creativity, these activities also fostered cultural appreciation, curiosity, and a spirit of inclusivity among our students.

**Confident Communicators**

At the end of the week, during CCE (FTGP) lessons, students were engaged in meaningful conversation about the significance of Racial Harmony and how it could be applied into our daily lives.&nbsp;

This discussion was triggered using videos and facilitated through cooperative learning strategies in the class and the focus was on the importance of being mindful of the cultural differences in Singapore so that we can express our cultural identities freely and respectfully. Students were also encouraged to share what they had learnt with their family as part of Lianhua’s Family Education.

#### **P5 NE Show 2023**

The National Education (NE) show is a rite of passage for Primary 5 students in Singapore and this year, Lianhua’s students went for their NE show on the 15th July. The show was held at The Padang, just like the very first National Day Parade in 1966.&nbsp;

The air was filled with excitement, and everyone was eager to partake in the festivities and embrace the spirit of patriotism. The atmosphere was electric, as our students gathered, adorned in red tops. The sea of vibrant colours, coupled with the infectious smiles and cheerful chatter of the students, created an ambiance of unity and national pride.

This year’s NE show is titled, “Building Our Shared Future As One”, and celebrates the diversity that forms the basis and fabric of our Singaporean identity and resilience as a nation. It comprises four live Acts, interwoven with three short films. The films feature Singaporeans and tell of their&nbsp; dreams, passions, aspirations and of their giving back to society.&nbsp;

The “Defending Our Nation as One” segment was also an eye-opener to all of us. It comprised the Parade and Ceremony (P&amp;C) and Total Defence Parade (TDP). Our students enjoyed the full-scale physical parade tremendously. The military tattoo performance featuring the combined talents of the SAF and SPF Bands, along with the combined schools’ band, as well as the choir music video, were also some of the crowd favourites.&nbsp;

Next up were the cultural performances, which showcased the vibrant multicultural heritage of Singapore. Performers from different ethnic groups performed traditional and contemporary pieces, reflecting the diversity and unity of the nation.

The aerial displays by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), featuring precision maneuvers, flypasts, and landings by the Red Lions parachutists, wowed our students and teachers.&nbsp;

However, the feather on the cap was, as always, the spectacular fireworks display, symbolising the nation’s progress and aspirations, that illuminated the Singapore skyline.

As the show came to a close, the audience united in a rousing rendition of Shine Your Light. Overall, NE show 2023 would no doubt be a memory to cherish, especially for our Primary 5 students and teachers! This experience has stirred up a renewed sense of love and patriotism for our country.

Catch their excitement and enthusiasm below!

#### **INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY 2023**

Lianhua Primary School commenced the commemoration of the International Friendship Day (IFD) on Tuesday, 4 April 2023. The IFD commemoration lasted til 14 April 2023. In line with this year’s theme–‘Singapore in Asia’, IFD@LHPS conducted programmes which focused on our diverse and colourful cultural identities, through which our students could foster the spirit of friendship, cooperation, and connectedness.&nbsp;

**Passionate Learners**

The IFD assembly began with mass singing of our own self-composed friendship songs, “La Vita E Bella” and “Best of Friends”. Supported by the Music Department, a group of student volunteers led the school in the singing of the two beautiful friendship songs, which are available on YouTube. Everyone sang and jived to the music.

In the Special Live Edition of News in Brief, three of our budding Primary Two newscasters covered news of Singapore’s friendship with other nations through political, economic, social, and cultural cooperation within ASEAN and Asia. They also highlighted LHPS’ hosting of students and teachers from Sanpatong Suwannarat Wittayakarn School (SSWS) from the province of Thailand in February. To celebrate the newfound friendship between LHPS and SSWS, some of the Thai students presented their traditional dance titled, “The Umbrella Dance”, to the school via a pre-recorded video. This segment ended off with our young newscasters conducting an exciting quiz for the whole school.&nbsp;

The main highlight of the assembly would be the Fashion Parade by our little supermodels, featuring their traditional costumes. Our international students showcased their supermodel talents by catwalking on stage and shared about their traditional costumes with the school.

**Creative and Critical Thinker**

The commemoration of the IFD continued during the recesses, where the students enjoyed a range of fun-filled activities at the various booths set up and run by parent volunteers and teachers. There was an iPad quiz booth where the lower primary students had to guess the name of the ASEAN countries while the middle primary students had to guess the ASEAN capital cities. For the upper primary students, they had to guess countries based on given emojis.&nbsp; In the Art Room, students had to think creatively on how to design a national costume for the school’s teddy bear with elements of ASEAN in their designs. There was even a Photo Booth for our students to pose a photo with their international friends. The IFD@Recess provided an authentic and fun experience for our students.

**Confident Communicators**

The IFD@LHPS experiences were brought back to the classrooms when the teachers revisited the topic during CCE lessons such as the Social Studies lessons and the CCE (FTGP) lessons. The discussions during these lessons allowed our students the opportunity to share their thoughts on the importance of international friendship for Singapore and the role of ASEAN in ensuring the survival of Singapore. The students were then asked to relate what they have learnt to their daily lives.&nbsp;

**Exemplary Leaders**

The challenge for all of us now is to be exemplary ambassadors for Singapore, both as a host to the international students both amongst us, as well as to students on exchange programmes visiting our school. To achieve this, which school values do you think are essential for our students to learn?

#### **Total Defence Day**&nbsp;

Lianhua Primary School commemorates Total Defence Day (TDD) by reminding all staff and students that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we all have a part to play to defend Singapore.  

Many activities were organised to provide our students the opportunities to learn, think, communicate their thoughts and to lead themselves and others during emergencies. These are the students’ outcomes that the school has embarked on to create a generation of concerned and future-ready citizens.

<b>**Passionate Learners**</b>

Our TDD assembly programme featured a skit titled ‘Together We Defend’. The skit tells the story of a group of residents in a sacred forest at a time of crisis. They had to come together despite their differences to maintain the peace and harmony in the community. Students were able to resonate the pillars of total defence with the story in a fun and interactive manner.

<b>**Creative and Critical Thinkers**</b>

Our students went through class-based discussions during CCE (FTGP) lessons on authentic emergency scenarios such as a fire as well as an attack at the mall. Students had to think on their feet on how to respond to such crises based on the tips provided.

<b>**Confident Communicator**</b>

Recess activities were specially designed for the students to express their understanding of and attitude towards the pillars of total defence. There was a quiz station to test them on cyber securities, an idea generator station to help a hungry teddy bear, a workout station to be a healthy and fit citizen, and even a Photo Booth for friends to pose a photo of strength in unity. Our students really surprised us with their wonderful responses.

<b>**Exemplary Leaders**</b>

A surprise fire drill was conducted in the early Tuesday morning this week. The drill seemed so real that some students were seen crying during the fire evacuation. Staff and students were also seen supporting those who are emotionally affected. Everybody managed to evacuate safely within 11 minutes 35 seconds. At the end of the drill, everyone understood the importance of taking care of self and others in times of emergency. Everyone agreed that the school will try to evacuate within 10 minutes in the next fire drills.
