Our students can look forward to:

##### Mission and Function of the School Library
The key roles of a future-ready school library in the 21st Century are to support reading, research, collaboration, studying and various activities that enable learning. The above five key roles of a school library (Reading, Research, Collaboration, Studying and Doing) as outlined in the 21st Century Framework for School Libraries prepares students for learning today and in the future.

In line with this mission, the Super Reader programme aims to equip students with 21st century competencies and dispositions to thrive and succeed in a VUCA world. **They aim to foster critical and creative thinking, ignite passion for reading, and nurture confident communicators and leaders.**

####  The Objectives of Super Reader Programme 
* The Super Reader Programme fosters a holistic approach to literacy by aligning with school values through engaging activities. 
* It inspires a love for reading, enhances creative and critical thinking, builds confident communicators, and develops exemplary leadership. 
* It aims to integrate the school’s core values and desired outcomes to cultivate passionate, creative, confident, and exemplary individuals.

### Supporting the Programme with SLS Learning Packages
To enhance the Super Reader Booklet experience, students benefit from **SLS Learning Packages**, which include:

* **Accompanying videos** for students to support independent learning.

### Library Visits and Integration with Curriculum
Students visit the library every week to explore various books and genres and participate in activities from the Super Reader Booklets. 

These visits align with the Library Curriculum:

* **English Teachers** take students to the library on even weeks.
* **Mother Tongue Teachers** guide them during odd weeks.

These visits provide students with the opportunity to engage with books in both English and Mother Tongue Languages, promoting a well-rounded literacy experience.

### Monthly Thematic Displays and Celebrations

We celebrate the world of books through monthly thematic displays that focus on different genres, authors, or reading themes. These displays highlight interesting books, authors’ birthdays, and more to encourage students to explore new titles and genres.

* **Author Birthdays:** We celebrate the birthdays of beloved authors, fostering students' appreciation for both established and emerging writers.
* **Book Talks by Student Librarians:** Our **student librarians** lead **Book Talks** to share their favorite reads, building public speaking skills and inspiring peers to read.

### Weekly Monday Recess Activities

Every Monday, we host exciting **recess activities** that engage students in fun, book-related challenges. We have interesting activities held in the library such as ‘Storytelling Videos’ which portrayed the school values of the month, ‘Guess the Genre’ where students read abstracts from books and guessed the genre and ‘Tongue Twisters’ which challenged the students in reciting the famous rhymes and poems. We also showcased our students’ talents in storytelling and book sharing at the Imaginarium. It has been very well received by our students and they enjoy supporting their school mates during recess.

#### News in Brief Programme

Every Wednesday, our school hall transforms into a newsroom for the News in Brief program, a vital part of our EL curriculum. This initiative keeps students informed about the latest news and events, aiming to nurture confident communicators and informed citizens.

Students become newscasters, presenting recent news from Singapore with clarity and confidence. By making connections between global events and their own lives, News in Brief broadens students' perspectives and deepens their understanding of global affairs.

Our Stories: Unveiling Singapore's Rich Tapestry

Our Stories, complementing News in Brief, explores Singapore's rich history and heritage. This fortnightly programme showcases diverse narratives shaping Singapore's identity. Students uncover tales of early pioneers and modern-day innovators, gaining insights into Singapore's evolution. The programme instills pride in Singapore's multicultural heritage, celebrating contributions from various communities. Our Stories fosters unity and inclusivity among students, helping them connect meaningfully with each other and their shared history.
