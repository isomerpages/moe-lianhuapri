<u>STELLAR Programme</u>

*   <p style="text-align: justify;">The STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) Programme was developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to cater to the diverse range of English language learners in Singapore. This programme has been implemented in our English Language curriculum from Primary One to Primary Six.</p>

*   <p style="text-align: justify;">The vision of STELLAR is to develop in children a love for reading and a strong foundation in the English Language and it aims to strengthen children’s learning of the English Language by using engaging and age-appropriate strategies and instructional materials.</p>

 
**Major Programmes**

**<u>Reading @ Lianhua</u>**

<p style="text-align: justify;">At Lianhua, we believe in cultivating the love of reading in our students so that they can experience an exciting life through the world of books. Our reading programme strives to bring these experiences to our students.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This year, our students are subscribing to myON® Reader that gives students access to digital books tailored to their reading interests and levels. Through the use of this reading portal, we hope that we can foster deeper student engagement with books and achieve greater reading growth. Additionally, students’ reading efforts will be recognised and will be awarded with certificates and/or tokens termly.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our daily pre-assembly programme, USSR (Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading) is a designated time for all students to do free voluntary reading. Silent reading helps them concentrate, with the focus on understanding the content of the book and in turn, derive pleasure from it.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This year for USSR, Lianhua has decided to incorporate the use of e-books/videos for a day each week so that the repertoire of stories which students have access to can be widened. Engagement activities such as active questioning and choral reading were also carried out during the session to check for students’ understanding and involvement level.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It has been observed that these e-books/ videos are well-received by our students. Students are always captivated by the videos shown. In this age of information and technology, we recognise the value of exposing our students to these electronic forms as they contain audio, video and animations which can enhance the message that the author is trying to convey. At the same time, they also provide strong visual cues to augment reading comprehension for the struggling readers and to encourage the unmotivated readers to read.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping our students’ interest in mind, our school will continue to orchestrate more wonderful reading programmes in the coming years. So, look forward to more fun activities! 

	
**<u>Oracy @ Lianhua</u>**

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">News in Brief is a platform that provides opportunities for our students to gain a brief insight into the life of a newscaster. They deliver news headlines as well as a short description of the day’s top stories on live telecast to the whole school on Fridays. Our English teachers guide them with the delivery of the news. For the majority of the students, it is likely to be their first public appearance and the experience is both nerve-wrecking, yet enriching for them. 

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In collaboration with News in Brief, Our Stories is another segment which allows our students to deepen their historical knowledge of Singapore. The segment allows students to know more about the stories behind famous historical buildings, events, people and street names of Singapore. Our Stories hopes to develop a sense of belonging and rootedness to our country and appreciate the rich history and contributions of our forefathers.
	
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Through these platforms, we hope to develop our newscasters into confident speakers and passionate learners. <br>

**<u>Stretch Your Mind - A Fun and Effective way to learn English</u>**

At Lianhua, we strive to develop our students into critical and creative thinkers. The English Department hence introduced a new pre-assembly segment, “Stretch Your Mind” where rebus puzzles are presented to students for them to solve.
Rebuses are a great tool for developing critical thinking skills. A rebus is a puzzle that uses pictures, symbols, or letters to represent words or phrases, and the solver must use logic and reasoning to figure out the meaning of the puzzle. Solving rebuses requires several critical thinking skills, including pattern recognition, inference, and deduction. For example, a rebus that includes an image of a heart, the letter "U", and the word "4" could be interpreted as "I love you forever." Solving this puzzle requires the solver to recognize the patterns and associations between the symbols and words.
Rebuses can also be used to enhance vocabulary and language skills, as they often require the solver to make connections between words and their meanings.
Stretch Your Mind will be a weekly Tuesday feature with levelled rebus puzzles for students to solve and learn English in a fun and meaningful manner.

**<u>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</u>**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The LSP is a specialised early intervention programme aimed at providing learning support to students who enter Primary 1 with weak literacy skills. Students are identified for LSP through a systematic screening process carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. The objective of the LSP is to equip students with basic literacy skills so that they could access learning in the regular classroom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The LSP is implemented by qualified teachers appointed by our school to be Learning Support Coordinators (LSCs). LSCs are given additional training by MOE HQ that equips them with specialised knowledge and skills to implement the programme. Students are supported daily for half an hour a day in groups of 8 to 10 students. Support continues in Primary 2 for students who need it.</p>

**<u>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)</u>**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The SDR programme is a two-year intervention for Primary Three and Four students who are identified through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary Two. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE. The curriculum has been designed taking into consideration the students’ learning profile and the contents of the mainstream English language curriculum. The school personnel conducting the programme also worked with the subject teachers and parents to closely monitor the students’ attendance and learning progress.</p>

**<u>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</u>**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for P3 and P4 students with reading difficulties. Specially trained EL teachers conduct targeted and focussed lessons to equip students with decoding and reading comprehension skills.</p>
