Framework for School Libraries prepares students for learning today and

<p>In line with this mission, the Super Reader programme aims to equip students

held in the library such as ‘Storytelling Videos’ which portrayed the school
values of the month, ‘Guess the Genre’ where students read abstracts from
books and guessed the genre and ‘Tongue Twisters’ which challenged the
students in reciting the famous rhymes and poems. We also showcased our

<h3>Oracy @ Lianhua</h3>
<h4>News in Brief Programme</h4>
<p>Every Wednesday, our school hall transforms into a newsroom for the News
in Brief program, a vital part of our EL curriculum. This initiative keeps
students informed about the latest news and events, aiming to nurture confident
communicators and informed citizens.</p>
<p>Students become newscasters, presenting recent news from Singapore with
clarity and confidence. By making connections between global events and
their own lives, News in Brief broadens students' perspectives and deepens
their understanding of global affairs.</p>

and heritage. This fortnightly programme showcases diverse narratives shaping
Singapore's identity. Students uncover tales of early pioneers and modern-day
innovators, gaining insights into Singapore's evolution. The programme

<h3>Stretch Your Mind</h3>
<p>Stretch Your Mind is a weekly Tuesday feature at Lianhua, designed to
spark creativity and enhance our students' mastery of the English Language.
We believe that creativity is a crucial part of a child’s development.
By engaging with similes, metaphors, and other figurative techniques, students
learn to express themselves more meaningfully and craft rich descriptions
for their stories.</p>
<p>Each week, we introduce new themes and language devices, challenging students
to think outside the box. Whether they are transforming everyday objects
into imaginative metaphors or describing settings with sensory-rich details,
they are constantly expanding their ability to communicate with depth and
confidence.</p>
<p>Beyond improving writing skills, Stretch Your Mind nurtures critical thinking
and self-expression skills that are essential not just in academics but
in life. As students become more skilled in using language creatively,
they gain the confidence to articulate their ideas, tell engaging stories,
and appreciate the beauty of words.</p>

<h3>EL Week</h3>

booths and captivating storytelling sessions. English Week aims not only
to foster a deep appreciation for language and literature but also to encourage
students to express themselves with confidence and flair. It's a week dedicated

<h3>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</h3>
<p>The LSP is a specialised early intervention programme aimed at providing
learning support to students who enter Primary 1 with weak literacy skills.
Students are identified for LSP through a systematic screening process
carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. The objective of the LSP is
to equip students with basic literacy skills so that they could access
learning in the regular classroom.</p>
<p>The LSP is implemented by qualified teachers appointed by our school to
be Learning Support Coordinators (LSCs). LSCs are given additional training
by MOE HQ that equips them with specialised knowledge and skills to implement
the programme. Students are supported daily for half an hour a day in groups
of 8 to 10 students. Support continues in Primary 2 for students who need
it.</p>
<h3>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)</h3>
<p>The SDR programme is a two-year intervention for Primary Three and Four
students who are identified through a systematic screening process for
dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary Two. The programme is conducted
in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum
designed by MOE. The curriculum has been designed taking into consideration
the students’ learning profile and the contents of the mainstream English
language curriculum. The school personnel conducting the programme also
worked with the subject teachers and parents to closely monitor the students’
attendance and learning progress.</p>
<h3>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</h3>
<p>The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for P3
and P4 students with reading difficulties. Specially trained EL teachers
conduct targeted and focussed lessons to equip students with decoding and
reading comprehension skills.</p>
