##### Mission and Function of the School Library
The key roles of a future-ready school library in the 21st Century are to support reading, research, collaboration, studying and various activities that enable learning. The above five key roles of a school library (Reading, Research, Collaboration, Studying and Doing) as outlined in the 21st Century Framework for School Libraries prepares students for learning today and in the future.

In line with this mission, the Super Reader programme aims to equip students with 21st century competencies and dispositions to thrive and succeed in a VUCA world. **They aim to foster critical and creative thinking, ignite passion for reading, and nurture confident communicators and leaders.**

####  The Objectives of Super Reader Programme 
* The Super Reader Programme fosters a holistic approach to literacy by aligning with school values through engaging activities. 
* It inspires a love for reading, enhances creative and critical thinking, builds confident communicators, and develops exemplary leadership. 
* It aims to integrate the school’s core values and desired outcomes to cultivate passionate, creative, confident, and exemplary individuals.

Students visit the library every week to explore various books and genres and participate in activities from the Super Reader Booklets. 

These visits align with the Library Curriculum:

These visits provide students with the opportunity to engage with books in both English and Mother Tongue Languages, promoting a well-rounded literacy experience.

We have interesting activities held in the library such as ‘Storytelling Videos’ which portrayed the school values of the month, ‘Guess the Genre’ where students read abstracts from books and guessed the genre and ‘Tongue Twisters’ which challenged the students in reciting the famous rhymes and poems. We also showcased our students’ talents in storytelling and book sharing at the Imaginarium. It has been very well received by our students and they enjoy supporting their school mates during recess.

#### News in Brief Programme

Every Wednesday, our school hall transforms into a newsroom for the News in Brief program, a vital part of our EL curriculum. This initiative keeps students informed about the latest news and events, aiming to nurture confident communicators and informed citizens.

Students become newscasters, presenting recent news from Singapore with clarity and confidence. By making connections between global events and their own lives, News in Brief broadens students' perspectives and deepens their understanding of global affairs.

Our Stories: Unveiling Singapore's Rich Tapestry

Our Stories, complementing News in Brief, explores Singapore's rich history and heritage. This fortnightly programme showcases diverse narratives shaping Singapore's identity. Students uncover tales of early pioneers and modern-day innovators, gaining insights into Singapore's evolution. The programme instills pride in Singapore's multicultural heritage, celebrating contributions from various communities. Our Stories fosters unity and inclusivity among students, helping them connect meaningfully with each other and their shared history.

### Stretch Your Mind
Stretch Your Mind is a weekly Tuesday feature at Lianhua, designed to spark creativity and enhance our students' mastery of the English Language. We believe that creativity is a crucial part of a child’s development. By engaging with similes, metaphors, and other figurative techniques, students learn to express themselves more meaningfully and craft rich descriptions for their stories.

Each week, we introduce new themes and language devices, challenging students to think outside the box. Whether they are transforming everyday objects into imaginative metaphors or describing settings with sensory-rich details, they are constantly expanding their ability to communicate with depth and confidence.

Beyond improving writing skills, Stretch Your Mind nurtures critical thinking and self-expression skills that are essential not just in academics but in life. As students become more skilled in using language creatively, they gain the confidence to articulate their ideas, tell engaging stories, and appreciate the beauty of words.

It is a celebration of language, literature, and creativity that promises an immersive experience for students, teachers, and parents alike. Throughout the week, our school will transform into a vibrant hub of English-related activities such as interactive games booths and captivating storytelling sessions. English Week aims not only to foster a deep appreciation for language and literature but also to encourage students to express themselves with confidence and flair. It's a week dedicated to nurturing the linguistic and creative talents of our students, and we invite parents to witness the blossoming of their children's literary skills.

### Learning Support Programme (LSP)

The LSP is a specialised early intervention programme aimed at providing learning support to students who enter Primary 1 with weak literacy skills. Students are identified for LSP through a systematic screening process carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. The objective of the LSP is to equip students with basic literacy skills so that they could access learning in the regular classroom.

The LSP is implemented by qualified teachers appointed by our school to be Learning Support Coordinators (LSCs). LSCs are given additional training by MOE HQ that equips them with specialised knowledge and skills to implement the programme. Students are supported daily for half an hour a day in groups of 8 to 10 students. Support continues in Primary 2 for students who need it.

### School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)

The SDR programme is a two-year intervention for Primary Three and Four students who are identified through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary Two. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE. The curriculum has been designed taking into consideration the students’ learning profile and the contents of the mainstream English language curriculum. The school personnel conducting the programme also worked with the subject teachers and parents to closely monitor the students’ attendance and learning progress.

### Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)

The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for P3 and P4 students with reading difficulties. Specially trained EL teachers conduct targeted and focussed lessons to equip students with decoding and reading comprehension skills.
