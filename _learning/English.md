and empower our students to become lifelong learners.</p>
<h5>Our Library: A Hub of Imagination</h5>
<p>Our school library is a dynamic space designed to inspire creativity,

<p>The key roles of a future-ready school library in the 21st Century are
to support reading, research, collaboration, studying and various activities
that enable learning. The above five key roles of a school library (Reading,
Research, Collaboration, Studying and Doing) as outlined in the 21st Century
Framework for School Libraries prepares students for learning today and
in the future.</p>
<p>In line with this mission, the Super Reader programme aims to equip students

a VUCA world. <strong>They aim to foster critical and creative thinking, ignite passion for reading, and nurture confident communicators and leaders.</strong>

<h3>Weekly Monday Recess Activities</h3>
<p>Every Monday, we host exciting <strong>recess activities</strong> that engage
students in fun, book-related challenges. We have interesting activities
held in the library such as ‘Storytelling Videos’ which portrayed the school
values of the month, ‘Guess the Genre’ where students read abstracts from
books and guessed the genre and ‘Tongue Twisters’ which challenged the
students in reciting the famous rhymes and poems. We also showcased our
students’ talents in storytelling and book sharing at the Imaginarium.
It has been very well received by our students and they enjoy supporting
their school mates during recess.</p>

<h3>Oracy @ Lianhua</h3>
<p>Oracy plays a vital role in developing our students into Confident Communicators,
Passionate Learners and Creative Thinkers. To support this vision, our
school has introduced three key programmes - News in Brief (NiB), Stretch
Your Mind and English Language (EL) Week - designed to strengthen students’
speaking and listening skills while fostering a love for learning.</p>
<h4>News in Brief Programme</h4>
<p>Every alternate Tuesday, our school hall transforms into a newsroom for
the News in Brief (NiB) programme, a vital part of our EL curriculum. This
initiative keeps students informed about the latest news and events, aiming
to nurture confident communicators and informed citizens.</p>
<p>Students become newscasters, presenting recent news from Singapore with
clarity and confidence. By making connections between global events and
their own lives, News in Brief broadens students' perspectives and deepens
their understanding of global affairs.</p>
<p>Our Stories: Unveiling Singapore's Rich Tapestry</p>
<p>Our Stories, complementing News in Brief, explores Singapore's rich history
and heritage. This fortnightly programme showcases diverse narratives shaping
Singapore's identity. Students uncover tales of early pioneers and modern-day
innovators, gaining insights into Singapore's evolution. The programme
instills pride in Singapore's multicultural heritage, celebrating contributions
from various communities. Our Stories fosters unity and inclusivity among
students, helping them connect meaningfully with each other and their shared
history.</p>

<h3>Stretch Your Mind</h3>
<p>Alternating with NiB on Tuesdays, Stretch Your Mind is designed to spark
creativity and enhance our students' mastery of the English Language. We
believe that creativity is a crucial part of a child’s development. By
engaging with similes, metaphors, and other figurative techniques, students
learn to express themselves more meaningfully and craft rich descriptions
for their stories.</p>
<p>Each week, we introduce new themes and language devices, challenging students
to think outside the box. Whether they are transforming everyday objects
into imaginative metaphors or describing settings with sensory-rich details,
they are constantly expanding their ability to communicate with depth and
confidence.</p>
<p>Beyond improving writing skills, Stretch Your Mind nurtures critical thinking
and self-expression skills that are essential not just in academics but
in life. As students become more skilled in using language creatively,
they gain the confidence to articulate their ideas, tell engaging stories,
and appreciate the beauty of words.</p>

<h3>EL Week</h3>
<p>English Week, an annual celebration, unfolds as a captivating week of
literary enchantment, eagerly awaited by all. It is a celebration of language,
literature, and creativity that promises an immersive experience for students,
teachers, and parents alike. Throughout the week, our school will transform
into a vibrant hub of English-related activities such as interactive games
booths and captivating storytelling sessions. English Week aims not only
to foster a deep appreciation for language and literature but also to encourage
students to express themselves with confidence and flair. It's a week dedicated
to nurturing the linguistic and creative talents of our students, and we
invite parents to witness the blossoming of their children's literary skills.</p>

<h3>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</h3>
<p>The LSP is a specialised early intervention programme aimed at providing
learning support to students who enter Primary 1 with weak literacy skills.
Students are identified for LSP through a systematic screening process
carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. The objective of the LSP is
to equip students with basic literacy skills so that they could access
learning in the regular classroom.</p>
<p>The LSP is implemented by qualified teachers appointed by our school to
be Learning Support Coordinators (LSCs). LSCs are given additional training
by MOE HQ that equips them with specialised knowledge and skills to implement
the programme. Students are supported daily for half an hour a day in groups
of 8 to 10 students. Support continues in Primary 2 for students who need
it.</p>
<h3>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)</h3>
<p>The SDR programme is a two-year intervention for Primary Three and Four
students who are identified through a systematic screening process for
dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary Two. The programme is conducted
in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum
designed by MOE. The curriculum has been designed taking into consideration
the students’ learning profile and the contents of the mainstream English
language curriculum. The school personnel conducting the programme also
worked with the subject teachers and parents to closely monitor the students’
attendance and learning progress.</p>
<h3>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</h3>
<p>The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for P3
and P4 students with reading difficulties. Specially trained EL teachers
conduct targeted and focussed lessons to equip students with decoding and
reading comprehension skills.</p>
