<u>Sports Day</u>

The school’s annual Sports Day comprises of a Track &amp; Field meet for the upper primary students, and our own version of a Spartan’s Race, Lianhua Superhero Challenge, for the lower primary students. The Track &amp; Field meet provides students with an experience of the Olympic Movement and serves as a platform for them to demonstrate the 21st Century Competencies and core values of the school.&nbsp; In addition, students can apply the athletics skills and knowledge learnt in their Physical Education (PE) curriculum.

Whereas the Lianhua Warrior Challenge allows parents and students to bond over physical activity in a carnival-like atmosphere.

The camp provides rich learning experiences outside the classroom walls that can help our students develop resilience and ruggedness. Students will also apply the skills learnt in their Outdoor Education in PE curriculum.
