Our students will have the opportunity to participate in two cohort camps, 2D1N P4 Camp and 3D2N P5 Camp. These camps provide rich learning experiences outside the classroom walls that can help our students develop resilience and ruggedness.Students will also apply the skills taught in OE in Physical Education (PE) curriculum in authentic outdoor environments.

The school’s annual Sports Day comprises of a Track &amp; Field meet for the upper primary students, and our own version of a Spartan’s Race, Lianhua Warrior Challenge, for the lower primary students. The Track &amp; Field meet provides students with the opportunity to experience the event as both competitors and spectators. Whereas the Lianhua Warrior Challenge allows parents and students to bond over physical activity in a carnival-like atmosphere. However, due to the Covid situation, we have stopped both events in 2020 and 2021. The CHAMP for Life carnival was organised in 2021 to launch the school’s CHAMP for Life LLP programme.

<u>Inter-Class Games</u>

The Sports Education Programme exposes students to a variety of sports beyond the PE curriculum. This exposure aims to generate students’ interests so that they will pick up the sport at a recreational level in the future to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

<u>Sports Enrichment Programme</u>

The Sports Enrichment Programme was introduced in 2017 to cater to the diverse sports interests of our students. These programmes were organised by our community partners (Warriors Football Club and Singapore Tennis Association) and with the help of parent volunteers.
