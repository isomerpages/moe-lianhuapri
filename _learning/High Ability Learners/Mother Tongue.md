The MTL Young Journalists Programme offers a fun and engaging platform for students to learn and use their Mother Tongue Language in authentic contexts. Through open dialogues and interviews, students are immersed in real-world communication experiences that help hone their speaking and writing skills. The programme aims to nurture confident speakers and effective writers by providing meaningful opportunities to express themselves and interact with others using their Mother Tongue.
