<p style="text-align: justify">Our Primary 5 Debate enrichment programme develops critical thinking and persuasive communication skills. Through structured debates on contemporary issues, students learn to analyse complex topics, construct compelling arguments and articulate their views with confidence and clarity. Under the guidance of experienced debate coaches, pupils master the art of research, logical reasoning and effective rebuttal - essential skills that extend into their academic journey and daily lives. This enrichment programme not only sharpens their analytical abilities but also cultivates empathy as they learn to understand and respond to different perspectives.

<p style="text-align: justify">Exploration and Inquiry Programme
Our High Ability Learners experience a unique approach to language learning through our Exploration and Inquiry programme. This innovative programme harnesses students' natural curiosity and analytical abilities through inquiry-based learning.
Students engage with language through stimulating questions and real-world challenges. Rather than following traditional methods, our learners actively seek knowledge and develop new understanding through investigation and discovery.
Our teachers facilitate this journey, guiding students whilst encouraging independence. This student-centred approach ensures each learner progresses meaningfully, developing both language mastery and critical thinking skills.
