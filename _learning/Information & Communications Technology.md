**ICT Department Vision:**  Every child a self-directed and engaged digital learner by harnessing ICT.

### Our Dedication:

With the designed ICT programmes and appropriate extensive use of e-platforms, our pupils will:    
a) Have intrinsic motivation to learn   
b) Take ownership of their learning  
c) Able to collaborate with others    
Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Robotics, Information and Technology in Education@Lianhua (RITE@Lianhua). More information on our ALP can be found <a href="https://lianhuapri.moe.edu.sg/learning/ict" target="_blank">here</a>.

### e-Platforms:

**Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)**  

Learning experiences have transformed over the years. Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) is an online learning portal specially designed to enable pupils to deepen their learning and better engage themselves in different learning modes such as self-directed learning and collaborative learning.    
Our teachers use a range of tools to customize and create purposeful and meaningful learning experiences that facilitate our pupils’ learning, catering to their needs. It also provides an equal access to learning resources to all pupils, extending their learning beyond the concrete building.
