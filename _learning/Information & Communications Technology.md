</p><p>We adhere to the FTAC frame to guide us in the development of our students’ digital literacy and technological skills. Digital literacy (DL) is defined as a set of knowledge, skills and dispositions that would help our learners to be confident, critical and responsible users of digital technologies for information, communication and problem-solving. Technological skills (TS) refer to the ability to understand and use specific technologies to solve problems and achieve practical goals.</p>
