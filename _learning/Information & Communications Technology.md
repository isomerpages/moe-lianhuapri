With the use of the multiple digital platforms in our school, students will be allowed to explore and create solutions to real-world problems. <br><br>They will also be taught to exercise cyber wellness in the application of these digital literacy and technology skills learnt in a safe and discerning manner.<br><br>We adhere to the FTAC frame to guide us in the development of our studentsâ€™ digital literacy and technological skills. Digital literacy (DL) is defined as a set of knowledge, skills and dispositions that would help our learners to be confident, critical and responsible users of digital technologies for information, communication and problem-solving.
