**Our Vision &amp; Mission**   
Vision: Every student is able to create, perform, listen and respond to music.   
Mission (3Es): To&nbsp;**educate**&nbsp;students in listening and understanding of musical elements and concepts.   
To&nbsp;**enable**&nbsp;students to create original music pieces.   
To&nbsp;**empower**&nbsp;students to perform music from the local and global cultures confidently.

  
Approach (ECA): Experience, Concept, Application


**Key Feature**

**SYF Youth Station Project**

The Youth Station Project is a platform dedicated to showcasing students’ original creative work in music. Through this platform, student-musicians are provided with opportunities to further develop their interest and skills in songwriting, composing, music arrangement, production and performing. Student-musicians also benefit from the mentoring provided by professional musicians through exposure to real-life practices and experiences of their mentors.

Through the years, the development of our student musicians is evident. As our students continue to be inspired by their seniors to compose and produce their own songs, their mastery of music has resulted in numerous national awards, which recognise the talent of our students and further affirm their passion and efforts in the area of music.&nbsp;

**Key Signature Programme**

**<u>Young Aspiring Song Composers</u>**

The ‘Young Aspiring Song Composers’ is one of the signature programmes in Lianhua Primary School. This programme strongly supports our school’s singing and song composition culture. The students brainstorm for ideas, create the lyrics and come up with melodies to compose their songs. This process taps on their creativity, develops their confidence and stretches their potential.

The self-composed songs are infused into our music curriculum. They are used as media that relay key messages, as well as to inculcate values such as ‘diligence’, ‘resilience’, ‘compassion’, ‘unity’ and ‘self-discipline.’ These songs have become part and parcel of Lianhua’s school life. For example, students learn to sing the cleaning songs to cultivate classroom and canteen cleaning habits; they sing the friendship songs to strengthen their relationships with their peers. All these subtly influence our students in their social and emotional learning as well as character development.

Singing the self-composed songs creates a sense of pride in students as the songs are unique to the school itself. The self-composed songs have been used as theme songs for National Education events like Racial Harmony Day and International Friendship Day. They have also been used during the celebration of Children’s Day, Sports Day, Prize-giving Day and P6 Graduation Ceremony in our school.

Songs raise people's spirits and bring forth hope and joy to everyone. At Lianhua Primary School, as long as we cherish music and song, we will continue to bond and grow together as a family.

**Major Programmes**

**<u>P1 &amp; P2 Shining Artz Celebration</u>**


The P1 &amp; P2 Shining Artz Celebration provides a platform for our students to perform on stage in front of an audience, largely made up of their parents. This is to build up their confidence level and to showcase what they have learned during the music lessons.&nbsp;

Through the process of preparing for the event, values such as ‘diligence’, ‘resilience’, ‘compassion’ and ‘unity’ are inculcated in our students.

In addition to the musical performances, our students’ visual art works are also displayed.&nbsp; These masterpieces are the final products of what they have been working on during their art lessons.&nbsp;

The event serves as a celebration of the efforts that our students have put in during their music and art lessons.

**<u>Showtime!</u>**

‘SHOWTIME!’ is one of Lianhua’s recess activities for our students to perform to their peers at the Imaginarium, which is situated near the canteen. Performances range from singing to playing of musical instruments. The Imaginarium is a platform to provide the performers with a non-threatening environment and allow them to develop greater confidence in themselves.
