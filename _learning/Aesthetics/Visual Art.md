<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We integrate the 4Es into our school's art framework to offer authentic learning experiences that align with school values, through the art curriculum, interdepartmental collaborations, and external partnerships.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <strong>4Es—Exposure, Experience, Enjoy, and Excel</strong>—guide our students' journey at Lianhua Primary School. Over six years, they will explore 28 artists' works and engage in diverse art forms and media through inquiry-based learning and CCE-infused lessons. In our art curriculum, we emphasize on process and inquiry- based learning. This approach encourages students to explore, experiment, and question throughout their artistic journey. Rather than focusing solely on the final product, students engage in open ended investigations, problem-solving, and critical thinking. They are encouraged to take risks, embrace mistakes as learning opportunities, and develop their own unique artistic voice. This fosters a deeper understanding of artistic processes, enhances creativity, and promotes self-directed learning. In their artmaking process and discussions, students will cultivate SEL (Social-Emotional Learning) values and 21st Century Competencies (21CC), which include:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>(1) Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking </strong><br>
Students are provided opportunities to explore and experiment with various ways of expressing ideas. They learn to take risks in artistic decisions, solve problems, reason effectively, and engage in critical reflection and evaluation during art discussions. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>(2) Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills: </strong><br>
In art discussions, students deepen their understanding by sharing ideas and creations. They become open to diverse perspectives, collaborate respectfully with peers, make compromises, and share and accept responsibility.
</p>

<strong>(3) Emphasis on Process and Inquiry-Based Learning</strong><br>
There is an emphasis on process-based learning, inquiry, and experimentation enables students to explore and develop their artistic skills through hands-on, experiential learning in real-world contexts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>(4) Focus on Creativity and Innovation </strong><br>
We seek to nurture creativity, critical thinking, and innovation in our art curriculum and programmes. This approach encourages students to explore unconventional ideas and approaches in their artistic endeavours.

<strong>(5) Integration of Technology</strong><br>
In the art curriculum, digital tools and technology are harnessed to enhance artistic expression and creativity, as well as to explore new forms of art and media. This integration helps students gain confidence and proficiency in art creation, allowing them to leverage a wider range of tools and media in their artistic practice.

**Major Programmes**<br>
**<u>Museum-Based Learning Programme</u>**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Museum-based learning module, our P4 students learn about local contexts and contemporary issues through local art exhibits in the National Gallery Singapore as part of their core learning experience. Students are introduced to various types of artworks and learned about Singapore’s artforms – both past and contemporary. 
<br><br>	
During the museum visit, students were introduced to visual-thinking routine questions that fostered critical thinking. By engaging in group activities, they sharpened their observation skills, analyzing the art elements and techniques used by the artists. This approach not only helped them appreciate the creative process but also developed their ability to think critically about the artwork’s meaning and context.
<br><br>	
Through discussions and collaborative learning, students were exposed to a variety of artworks reflecting Singapore’s artistic heritage – both historical and contemporary. This encouraged them to engage deeply with the stories behind the art, better understanding the evolution of Singapore’s art scene. By working together, students were able to share different perspectives and insights, enhancing their appreciation of the artworks and strengthening their connection to Singapore’s culture. 
<br><br>	
At the end of their learning journey, the students will reflect upon their experiences at the museum and apply this in the pieces they will create in response.

**Digital Media Programme**

Our P1 and P2 students undergo iPad photography lessons as part of their digital media module. In this learning experience, students explore different parts of the school environment to capture images using iPads. They then apply basic photo composition techniques and patterns. Students acquire SEL skills as they work together with peers to learn to take and review their photos. At the end of the module, students’ work would be exhibited in school.
