**Key Feature**

We incorporate the 4Es in our school’s art framework to provide authentic learning experiences for students aligned with the school values through the art curriculum, interdepartmental collaborations and external collaborations. The 4Es are Exposure, Experience, Enjoy and Excel. In the 6 years at Lianhua Primary School, our students will learn about 32 artists’ artworks and explore artmaking in different art forms and media through the inquiry-based learning approach and CCE infused lessons. As they learn to see, express and appreciate the artworks, students will learn to generate responses, conceptualise ideas, investigate and express. In the process, students would acquire 21CC skills, SEL values and critical thinking skills. To enrich our students’ learning experience, students are given the opportunity to create art pieces to contribute back to the community through art collaborations with external partners. Platforms are provided for students to excel and showcase their artwork at external platforms i.e SYF Art Lab, SYF Art Exhibitions and other art competitions.

**Key Signature Programme**

**<u>Visual Art Jam!</u>**


Visual Art Jam! is a platform for all students to explore different art forms within and beyond the Art curriculum to extend their knowledge and skills in art-making. To complement other school experiences, the activities are planned based on themes and events taking place in school. For one of the Visual Art Jam activities, in conjunction with our 75th anniversary celebrations, we have organised a special Visual Art Jam! Edition called the Garden of Hope to align with the anniversary theme - Making a Difference. For this, we invited our students, staff and parent volunteers to aesthetically express how they could make a difference to society and beyond. Through this hands-on activity, everyone had the opportunity to relate and connect with the world around them and share how they could make a difference through Art.

  

Through this platform, we hope to provide students with an alternative mode of self-expression of what they have learnt. To encourage and motivate students, our students’ masterpieces are displayed @ Art Star Interactive Corner. By displaying our students’ work, we want to recognise all students for their efforts, regardless of ability or talent.
