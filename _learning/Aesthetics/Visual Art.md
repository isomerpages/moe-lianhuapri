<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We integrate the 4Es into our school's art framework to offer authentic learning experiences that align with school values, through the art curriculum, interdepartmental collaborations, and external partnerships.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <strong>4Es—Exposure, Experience, Enjoy, and Excel</strong>—guide our students' journey at Lianhua Primary School. Over six years, they will explore 28 artists' works and engage in diverse art forms and media through inquiry-based learning and CCE-infused lessons. In our art curriculum, we emphasize on process and inquiry- based learning. This approach encourages students to explore, experiment, and question throughout their artistic journey. Rather than focusing solely on the final product, students engage in open ended investigations, problem-solving, and critical thinking. They are encouraged to take risks, embrace mistakes as learning opportunities, and develop their own unique artistic voice. This fosters a deeper understanding of artistic processes, enhances creativity, and promotes self-directed learning. In their artmaking process and discussions, students will cultivate SEL (Social-Emotional Learning) values and 21st Century Competencies (21CC), which include:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>(1) Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking </strong><br>
Students are provided opportunities to explore and experiment with various ways of expressing ideas. They learn to take risks in artistic decisions, solve problems, reason effectively, and engage in critical reflection and evaluation during art discussions. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>(2) Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills: </strong><br>
In art discussions, students deepen their understanding by sharing ideas and creations. They become open to diverse perspectives, collaborate respectfully with peers, make compromises, and share and accept responsibility.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>(3) Emphasis on Process and Inquiry-Based Learning</strong><br>
There is an emphasis on process-based learning, inquiry, and experimentation enables students to explore and develop their artistic skills through hands-on, experiential learning in real-world contexts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>(4) Focus on Creativity and Innovation </strong><br>
We seek to nurture creativity, critical thinking, and innovation in our art curriculum and programmes. This approach encourages students to explore unconventional ideas and approaches in their artistic endeavours. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>(5) Integration of Technology</strong><br>
In the art curriculum, digital tools and technology are harnessed to enhance artistic expression and creativity, as well as to explore new forms of art and media. This integration helps students gain confidence and proficiency in art creation, allowing them to leverage a wider range of tools and media in their artistic practice.

**Key Signature Programme**

**<u>Visual Art Jam!</u>**


Visual Art Jam! is a platform for all students to explore different art forms within and beyond the Art curriculum to extend their knowledge and skills in art-making. To complement other school experiences, the activities are planned based on themes and events taking place in school. For one of the Visual Art Jam activities, in conjunction with our 75th anniversary celebrations, we have organised a special Visual Art Jam! Edition called the Garden of Hope to align with the anniversary theme - Making a Difference. For this, we invited our students, staff and parent volunteers to aesthetically express how they could make a difference to society and beyond. Through this hands-on activity, everyone had the opportunity to relate and connect with the world around them and share how they could make a difference through Art.

  

Through this platform, we hope to provide students with an alternative mode of self-expression of what they have learnt. To encourage and motivate students, our students’ masterpieces are displayed @ Art Star Interactive Corner. By displaying our students’ work, we want to recognise all students for their efforts, regardless of ability or talent.

**Major Programmes**

**<u>Museum-Based Learning Programme</u>**

In the Museum-based learning module, our P4 students learn about local contexts and contemporary issues through local art exhibits in the National Gallery Singapore as part of their core learning experience. Students are introduced to various types of artworks and learned about Singapore’s artforms – both past and contemporary.&nbsp;


Students are exposed to visual-thinking routine questions in the group activities. This helps to develop critical thinking skills and allows them to better appreciate the art elements and techniques used by the artists in their artworks. In the process, students develop visual observation skills, appreciation of local art, culture and heritage. They also take pride in being part of the Singapore art scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;


At the end of their learning journey, the students will reflect upon their experiences at the museum and apply this in the pieces they will create in response.

**Digital Media Programme**

Our P1 and P2 students undergo iPad photography lessons as part of their digital media module. In this learning experience, students explore different parts of the school environment to capture images using iPads. They then apply basic photo composition techniques and patterns. Students acquire SEL skills as they work together with peers to learn to take and review their photos. At the end of the module, students’ work would be exhibited in school.

**<u>P1 &amp; P2 Shining Artz Celebration</u>**

The P1 &amp; P2 Shining Artz Celebration aims to showcase our students’ talents in Visual Art curriculum featuring artworks ranging from two-dimensional artworks- drawings to three-dimensional artworks – food plastiscines, and ICT works – iPad photography works from the Digital Media module. Selected student art leaders would serve as art emcees or art guides to introduce artworks and interview visitors. This is to provide students with similar roles and experience akin to the SYF Art Exhibition.

**<u>Outreach Art Programmes</u>**


Our school seeks to provide authentic and meaningful learning experiences to incorporate school values and the 21CC skills in our students through collaborations with external partners aligned with the school vision – Hearts of Service. In these collaborations, our students, teachers and School Leaders came forth to express their creativity and contribute art pieces which were displayed in external physical exhibition areas or virtual exhibitions to reach out to different audiences. In 2020, we collaborated with Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and National University Polyclinics to create 224 notes of appreciation for the frontline healthcare workers. In 2017-2019, we collaborated with Bukit Gombak Constituency to commemorate National Day- Plank Art Painting followed by P3 VIA Nagomi Art Project in 2021. In 2022, we collaborated with Bukit Gombak Constituency to paint 2 canvases to express the unique artistic representations of Bukit Gombak neighbourhood at Little Guilin.
