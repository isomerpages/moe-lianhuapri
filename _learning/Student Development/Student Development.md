<p>In Lianhua Primary School, we aim to develop our students into ‘Exemplary
Leaders’ by focusing on four key focus areas: Good character, Social Emotional Well-Being,
Mental and Physical Well-Being, and Leadership.</p>

‘Optimal Functioning', forms the core of the work of the Student Development
Team. It comprises teams from the Character &amp; Citizenship Education, Student Leadership Development and Student Well Being. </p>
