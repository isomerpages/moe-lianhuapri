<h2><strong>Student Development</strong></h2>
<p>In Lianhua Primary School, we aim to develop our students into ‘Exemplary
Leaders’ by focusing on four key focus areas: Good character, Social Emotional,
Mental and physical and Leadership.</p>
<br>
<p>The four key focus areas in student development are then further unpacked
into six different aspects of positive functioning. These six different
aspects of positive functioning are based on Prof Carol Ryff’s model of
‘Optimal Functioning’, which forms the theoretical model of psychological
well-being. The six different aspects of positive functioning are namely,
autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, positive
relations with others and self-acceptance.</p>
<br>
<p>The ‘Exemplary Leaders’ four key focus areas, anchored by the model of
‘Optimal Functioning, forms the core of the work of the Student Development
Team.</p>
<br>
<p>These key focus areas are cascaded down to the holistic development of
our students via the character development programmes, the citizenship
development programmes, the student leadership development programmes and
the student well-being programmes.</p>
