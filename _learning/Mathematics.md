<h3><strong>Department Vision</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Confident Maths Learners<br>
Competent Maths Teachers<br>
Effective Problem Solvers</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with our school vision, mission and values, we wish to develop in our students the mathematical knowledge and skills that are required in many disciplines and for everyday use as well as to build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With the belief that every child can learn Mathematics, and through the dedicated support and guidance from our competent Maths teachers, every Lianhuarean will become an effective problem solver.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>Learn by Doing</i></strong><br>
Students actively participate in learning experiences through practical activities and the use of manipulatives.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>Learn by Interacting</i></strong><br>
Students learn from one another by communicating ideas and justifying their thinking to gain deeper understanding.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>Learn by Reflecting</i></strong><br>
Students take charge of their own learning and work towards the goals they set by monitoring their own progress, improving work processes and evaluating learning outcomes.</p>

<h3><strong><i>GEAR UP</i></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our GEAR UP process is an approach adapted from George Polya’s 4 steps to problem solving. It serves to guide our students in their mental processing of word problems in a more systematic manner. The strong emphasis on reasoning and analysis in this process helps students develop essential learning skills, enhance their metacognitive abilities, and build confidence in mathematical problem-solving.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students also learn various heuristics to help them solve mathematical problems. Heuristics are methods and strategies that point towards possible ways in which students might be able to find a solution. With the acquisition of mathematical skills and processes, coupled with the content knowledge, students will become better problem solvers.</p>

<h3><strong><i>Fun with Mathematics</i></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fun with Mathematics is a programme for selected P4 to P6 students with the aptitude for Mathematics. The programme aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to:</p>
