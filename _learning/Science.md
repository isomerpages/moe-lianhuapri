<h5><strong>OUR VISION:</strong></h5>

To nurture students as inquirers.

<h5><strong>OUR PEOPLE:</strong></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Science Department of Lianhua Primary consists of experienced teachers who are united with a common purpose—to inculcate Science knowledge and values in our students through planned execution of fun learning experiences.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our science teachers serve as leaders of inquiry in the classroom, fostering an environment that nurtures curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. Through this approach, students develop essential skills and gain a deeper understanding of scientific concepts. We also integrate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) mindsets into our lessons to cultivate students' interest in Science while enhancing their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>

<h6><strong>FOCUS in Science</strong></h6>
<img style="width:500px;height:600px;" src="/images/Learning/Science/FocusInScience2025.png">

<p style="text-align: justify;">Teachers in our school adopt the FOCUS in Science framework to develop students’ scientific thinking and structured responses. This structured approach enables students to tackle Science questions with clarity and precision, boosting their confidence.</p>


<strong>SOME OF OUR PROGRAMMES AT A GLANCE:</strong>
* POTS (Primary One and Two Science)
* Yes! Programme (Young Exploring Scientists! Programme)
* Science@Home Programme
* Fun With Science
* Eco-Stewardship@LHPS

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>POTS (PRIMARY ONE AND TWO SCIENCE)</strong><br>To enrich our students’ learning experiences, our school has crafted a special curriculum to give our students a headstart in the learning of Science in Primary 1 and 2.  We have aligned the curriculum with our school’s student outcomes, namely <i>Passionate Learner, Critical and Creative Thinker, Confident Communicator and Exemplary Leader</i>, and MOE Science Syllabus 2023. This curriculum is aptly named POTS (Primary One and Two Science) as we are the “pots” with the nourishment for our young and naturally curious “seedlings” (our students) to grow and blossom.
<br>
<br>
The lessons often take place in our science garden where students, as exemplary leaders,  learn about flora and fauna and nature manners. In the course of the learning, our students’ passion in science is ignited and they are given opportunities to be critical and creative thinkers with the questions they ask and share confidently the discoveries they have made. They also develop their practices of science such as observing, classifying, comparing and communicating when they learn about different animal groups and plants.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>YES! (YOUNG EXPLORING SCIENTISTS) PROGRAMME AND OUR SCIENCE STEWARDS</strong><br>
The world is constantly evolving. How do we at Lianhua Primary prepare our students for their future so that they can stay relevant?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our answer to that is the Young Exploring Scientists! (YES!) programme. Through this programme, we aim to inculcate STEM skills and mindset to prepare the younger generation for rapid technological advancements. In this programme, P3 to P6 students are exposed to the construction of science toys and STEM challenges. They are also given opportunities to participate in level-based programmes that were specifically selected for their alignment to the science concepts and topics that they are learning.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Science Toys and STEM Challenges</strong><br>
The use of science toys actively creates learning opportunities for students to experiment and extend their learning beyond the classroom. More often than not, students do not successfully complete the creation of the science toys within the first try. This is the same for STEM challenges where students design their own prototypes and test out the suitability of the designs in fulfilling the challenge requirements. The process of creating and testing, then refining, is a long and tedious one, but students are encouraged by their teachers and spurred on by the successes of their peers to persevere until they do succeed. This is part of the STEM mindset. In STEM, mistakes and failed attempts are viewed as positive experiences, offering opportunities for deeper learning and questioning that will lead to eventual success. It also encourages resilience, which is a core value of our school.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Level-based Programmes</strong><br>
For learning to take place effectively, there must be hands-on, active participation. The level-based programmes in YES! empower students to take greater responsibility in their learning as they participate in activities that are aligned with the curriculum.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>P4 – Indoor Hydroponics</u><br>
In this densely populated country, where land and resources are scarce, hydroponics could just be a solution to Singapore’s food supply vulnerabilities. Our P4 students had the opportunity to experience the future of farming in their classrooms! They germinated seeds, transplanted them and cared for them. After weeks of dedication and care, they harvested and were rewarded with fruits of their labour.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>P5 – Gardening</u><br>
Equipped with the experience from Indoor Hydroponics, our Primary 5 Science Stewards dedicated their time and effort on food sustainability, growing Spanish Spinach in the school’s garden. They used the compost from the P6 Composting programme to enrich the soil. With some tender, loving care, the Spanish Spinach was ready to harvest within weeks. The harvested Spanish Spinach was then taken to the canteen for our canteen vendors to cook - a true definition of the Farm-to-Table concept.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>P6 – Composting</u><br>
Our Primary 6 students showed how sustainability could be achieved even within the small compound of our very own school. Science Stewards from various P6 classes had their first-hand experience in amassing compost. The compost was later used to fertilise the soil for plants to thrive in the school. Food waste such as banana skins were broken down by the African Night Crawlers in the soil to produce compost.</p>
