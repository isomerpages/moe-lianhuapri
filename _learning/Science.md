<h1><strong>Science</strong></h1>

<h5><strong>OUR VISION:</strong></h5>

To nurture the student as an inquirer

<h5><strong>OUR PEOPLE:</strong></h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Science Department of Lianhua Primary consists of experienced teachers who are united with a common purpose—to inculcate Science knowledge and values in our students through planned execution of fun learning experiences. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our science teachers act as leaders of inquirers in the science classroom by creating a learning environment that fosters curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. This approach enables our students to develop important skills and a deeper understanding of scientific concepts. We also incorporate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) mindsets and attributes in science lessons for our students to foster their interest in Science and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>


<strong>SOME OF OUR PROGRAMMES AT A GLANCE:</strong>
* <strong>POTS (Primary One and Two Science)</strong>
* <strong>Yes! Programme (Young Exploring Scientists! Programme)</strong>
* <strong>Science@Home Programme</strong>
* <strong>Fun With Science</strong>
* <strong>Eco-Stewardship@LHPS</strong>

<u><strong></strong></u><p style="text-align: justify;"><u><strong>POTS (PRIMARY ONE AND TWO SCIENCE)</strong></u><br>To enrich our students’ learning experiences, our school has crafted a special curriculum to give our students a headstart in the learning of Science in Primary 1 and 2.  We have aligned the curriculum with our school’s student outcomes, namely <i>Passionate Learner, Critical and Creative Thinker, Confident Communicator and Exemplary Leader</i>, and MOE Science Syllabus 2023. This curriculum is aptly named POTS (Primary One and Two Science) as we are the “pots” with the nourishment for our young and naturally curious “seedlings” (our students) to grow and blossom.
<br>
<br>
The lessons often take place in our science garden where students, as exemplary leaders,  learn about flora and fauna and nature manners. In the course of the learning, our students’ passion in science is ignited and they are given opportunities to be critical and creative thinkers with the questions they ask and share confidently the discoveries they have made. They also develop their practices of science such as observing, classifying, comparing and communicating when they learn about different animal groups and plants.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In term 4, after a culmination of what they have experienced in P1 and P2 POTS, they take on the role of a field scientist to hone their skills and deepen their understanding.  They continue their exploration and discovery-making beyond the classroom.<br>
