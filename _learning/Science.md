# **Science**


##### **OUR VISION:**  

To nurture the student as an inquirer

##### **OUR PEOPLE:**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Science Department of Lianhua Primary consists of experienced teachers who are united with a common purpose—to inculcate Science knowledge and values in our students through planned execution of fun learning experiences. </p>

<p>Our science teachers act as leaders of inquirers in the science classroom by creating a learning environment that fosters curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. This approach enables our students to develop important skills and a deeper understanding of scientific concepts. We also incorporate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) mindsets and attributes in science lessons for our students to foster their interest in Science and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>


**SOME OF OUR PROGRAMMES AT A GLANCE:**
* **POTS (Primary One and Two Science)**
* **Yes! Programme (Young Exploring Scientists! Programme)**
* **Science@Home Programme**
* **Fun With Science**

<u><strong>POTS (PRIMARY ONE AND TWO SCIENCE)</strong></u><br>
Our school has crafted a special curriculum to give our students a headstart in the learning of Science in Primary 1 and 2.  Children are naturally curious and to provide an environment for our young “seedlings” to grow (our young students), we are the “pots” with the nourishment.

<p>Students have hands-on activities to learn about the world around them, specifically the flora and fauna.  In addition, through play, they also develop their basic skills such as observing, classifying, comparing and measuring.</p>

<u><strong>YES! (YOUNG EXPLORING SCIENTISTS) PROGRAMME AND OUR SCIENCE STEWARDS</strong></u><br>
The world is constantly evolving. How do we at Lianhua Primary prepare our students for their future so that they can stay relevant?

Our answer to that is the Young Exploring Scientists! (YES!) programme. Through this programme, we aim to inculcate STEM skills and mindset to prepare the younger generation for rapid technological advancements. In this programme, P3 to P6 students are exposed to the construction of science toys and STEM challenges. They are also given opportunities to participate in level-based programmes that were specifically selected for their alignment to the science concepts and topics that they are learning.<br>

**Science Toys and STEM Challenges**<br>
The use of science toys actively creates learning opportunities for students to experiment and extend their learning beyond the classroom. More often than not, students do not successfully complete the creation of the science toys within the first try. This is the same for STEM challenges where students design their own prototypes and test out the suitability of the designs in fulfilling the challenge requirements. The process of creating and testing, then refining, is a long and tedious one, but students are encouraged by their teachers and spurred on by the successes of their peers to persevere until they do succeed. This is part of the STEM mindset. In STEM, mistakes and failed attempts are viewed as positive experiences, offering opportunities for deeper learning and questioning that will lead to eventual success. It also encourages resilience, which is a core value of our school.

**Level-based Programmes**<br>
For learning to take place effectively, there must be hands-on, active participation. The level-based programmes in YES! empower students to take greater responsibility in their learning as they participate in activities that are aligned with the curriculum.


**P4 – Indoor Hydroponics**<br>
In this densely populated country, where land and resources are scarce, hydroponics could just be a solution to Singapore’s food supply vulnerabilities. Our P4 students had the opportunity to experience the future of farming in their classrooms! They germinated seeds, transplanted them and cared for them. After weeks of dedication and care, they harvested and were rewarded with fruits of their labour.

**P5 – Gardening**<br>
Equipped with the experience from Indoor Hydroponics, our Primary 5 Science Stewards dedicated their time and effort on food sustainability, growing Spanish Spinach in the school's garden. They used the compost from the P6 Composting programme to enrich the soil. With some tender, loving care, the Spanish Spinach was ready to harvest within weeks. The harvested Spanish Spinach was then taken to the canteen for our canteen vendors to cook - a true definition of the Farm-to-Table concept.

**P6 – Composting**<br>
Our Primary 6 students showed how sustainability could be achieved even within the small compound of our very own school. Science Stewards from various P6 classes had their first-hand experience in amassing compost. The compost was later used to fertilise the soil for plants to thrive in the school. Food waste such as banana skins were broken down by the African Night Crawlers in the soil to produce compost.

**Science Stewards**<br>
‘One is never too small to make a difference’.

Lianhua Primary School has a passionate group of youngsters who commit their time and energy to preserving the school’s flora and fauna. This special group of people make up the LHPS Science Stewards.

These Science Stewards are volunteers from various classes of differing levels and they range from P3 to P6. Upon confirmation of their Science Stewards status, these students are trained to assist in the running of Science programmes and challenges across the different levels. <br>

<u><strong>SCIENCE@HOME PROGRAMME</strong></u><br>
One of the things that makes learning Science really fun is the opportunity to explore and learn about scientific concepts and phenomena through experimentation.


To this purpose, each P3-P6 pupil was provided with a Science Kit that was relevant to a topic they were learning about that year. SLS lessons were then crafted by members of the department and assigned to the pupils. The lessons were designed to allow students to explore the topic in greater detail and to be able to experiment in science lessons as well as at home. In turn, their experiments led to discussions among their peers about the scientific phenomena that they had discovered.

<u><strong>FUN WITH SCIENCE</strong></u><br>
Fun with Science is a programme for selected students who have done exceptionally well in Science. It is meant to stretch students who already have a firm foundation in basic Science and who have a passion for Science and Science phenomena.

Fun with Science lessons foster an environment that stimulates intellectual curiosity and encourages hands-on exploration. Through engaging and challenging science investigations, these students are provided with opportunities to apply their analytical skills and creativity to scientific problems. The goal is to inspire a deep passion for inquiry, critical thinking, and problem-solving, allowing them to delve into scientific concepts with enthusiasm. By designing and conducting their own investigations, the students not only deepen their understanding of scientific principles but also develop essential skills in experimental design, data analysis, and effective communication. Fun with Science lessons go beyond curriculum, providing an enriching and dynamic experience that cultivates a lifelong love for scientific discovery.

<u><strong>A glance at some of our programmes:</strong></u><br>
**1. Eco Stewardship – P1 and P2 Nearpod 3Rs lesson**<br>
The Primary 1 and 2 students had an interactive lesson on the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). The lesson was conducted using Nearpod. Nearpod is an online tool that allows teachers to use slide-based teaching in the classroom. The use of virtual reality in Nearpod allowed students to have the opportunity to explore the Semakau Landfill, very similar to a school trip but without a limit on distance. At the end of the lesson, the students reported having a greater understanding of the 3Rs.

**2. Eco 6-Week Challenge** <br>
To develop in our students greater awareness of the environment and how to live in a more sustainable manner, Lianhua Primary School elected to participate in a 6-week sustainability app challenge, supported by the SG Eco Fund of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE). The campaign also aims to reach out to families through our students to reduce waste through reducing, reusing and recycling.

A total of 386 staff, students and their families unleashed the superheroes within them by adopting Zero Waste Habits from 10th July 2023 to 6th August 2023 by participating in exciting challenges around waste reduction, reusing, recycling and composting both in school and at home via the susGain Impact app.

We had a total of four Superhero Challenges for our participants: Clean Plate Challenge, Recycle Used Cooking Oil Challenge, Clothes Swapping Challenge and Recycle Tetra Paks and Milk Cartons Challenge. At the end of the campaign, our school donated 11.8 kg of used cooking oil, 67 milk cartons, 390 metal cans, 45 HPDE bottles and 987 pieces of secondhand clothing. Thanks to the effort of our staff and students, we managed to reuse and/or recycle the above-mentioned items that would have otherwise been sent to the landfills.<br>
