Through our Alumni activities, we hope to have a strong sense of belonging to the school, and facilitate this mutually beneficial exchange between our Alumni and the school. In this manner, the Alumni can express their school spirit through engaging in common activities with their old schoolmates, and the school can enjoy the practical contributions provided by the Alumni.

#### Homecoming Day

Homecoming Day is organized on a yearly basis with different themes to encourage ex-students and ex-staff to reconnect with and establish a sense of belonging to our school. This event strongly brings out our school core value of Loyalty' and many of our students continue to come back with success stories to share with us. This event not only allows us to reunite, it also establishes new connections as our alumni return and contribute to our school in one way or another.
