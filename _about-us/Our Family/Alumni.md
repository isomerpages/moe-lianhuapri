Through our Alumni activities, we hope to have a strong sense of belonging to the school, and facilitate this mutually beneficial exchange between our Alumni and the school. In this manner, the Alumni can express their school spirit through engaging in common activities with their old schoolmates, and the school can enjoy the practical contributions provided by the Alumni.

#### Homecoming Day

Homecoming Day is organized on a yearly basis with different themes to encourage ex-students and ex-staff to reconnect with and establish a sense of belonging to our school. This event strongly brings out our school core value of Loyalty' and many of our students continue to come back with success stories to share with us. This event not only allows us to reunite, it also establishes new connections as our alumni return and contribute to our school in one way or another.

Inspiring stories and wonderful memories of LHPS are collected through Facebook, along with interviews to engage our Alumni. These stories and well-wishes instill in us a sense of pride of being a Lianhuarean and motivates us to do even better in the years to come.

  

#### Alumni’s Voices

  
**Ms Sharon Lim Poh Ling (Year 2000)**

After I've graduated from Lianhua Primary School, who would have thought that one day, I'd come back to the school again and contribute to the school?

  

I was a student of Lianhua Primary School 12 years ago. In this school, I got to know my bestie, Amanda Loo. We shared a lot of memories together. All these contributed to our growth and now when we meet up with each other, the days in school will always be one of our topics of conversation.

  

I am currently doing my Degree in Chinese Language and Literature with Translation in the Singapore University of Social Sciences and I would like to say a very big Thank You to Mdm Woo Yeong Yi! She was my Chinese teacher when I was in P4 and P6 and because of her, I'm able to do well in my Chinese Language, and am now, persuing my studies in the relevant field. Thank you Ms Woo! Thank you for all the guidance that you have given to me.

  

I hope that all Lianhua students will have what the school values stated, in their character. 吃得苦中苦，方为人上人。(No pain, no gain) I hope that all students will be able to give in their best, and never give up. Perseverance is the key to success!

29th SEA Games   
ICE SKATING – SHORT TRACK SPEED SKATING MEN’S 3000M RELAY FINALS   
TEAM OF NG JUN JIE LUCAS, CHONG MIKI, CHUA QI EN, LIM CHIA YEH AND LIM JUN HAO   
Time: 4:37.113. They finished 2nd out of 4 and clinched the Silver medal.

**Mr Lim Jun Hao (Year 2012)**

Age, 7. No… I was 6 years and 2 months old when I first stepped into Lianhua Primary, fresh out of kindergarten. I was your ordinary, fresh-out-of-the-mill Primary 1 student who did not get the concept of studying. I definitely thought it was just all fun and games

  

However, through the years in Lianhua and various experiences, I learnt a sense of responsibility and that I am responsible for my actions. I learnt how to complete my assignments on time and that my actions do matter. At that time, Lianhua’s school values had the acronym of S.M.A.R.T.E.R., R for Responsibility. Even though responsibility may not be in Lianhua’s core school values now, having been changed to C.H.U.R.D.L.E.S., it is still important to keep in mind that for any action you take, there will be consequences that you will have to be responsible for.

  

Consequences don't necessarily have to be negative. Consequences may also have positive outcomes. An example would be how I discovered the sport, short track speed skating. Like every lost teenager, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and prioritized the enjoyment of my youth. Therefore, when my friends asked me out for an ice skating session, naturally I said “yes”

That’s how it all started, how skating entered my life. However, I did not want to skate recreationally, hence I started doing research about skating to find out more about this sport. I found out that ice skating was spilt into 3 types; Figure Skating, Short Track and Ice Hockey. The sport that hooked me in the most; you’ve guessed it, Short Track. Watching skaters fighting it out on the ice in races to see who is the fastest skater made me rush with adrenaline. I had decided. I was going to learn short track.

  

2 ½ years later, I managed to get into the national team. It may sound easy on paper, but in that 2 ½ years, I had to catch up to the other skaters who had already been skating for some time. The challenges that I faced seemed insurmountable. To improve my skills, I had to make many sacrifices. At 7pm on weekdays, you would be at the dinner table with your family, ready to have your daily family dinner. I did not have such privileges. At 7pm, I was down at the stadium, waiting for training to commence. During that time, the values of perseverance and resilience inculcated from a tender age aided me

  

It paid off. I received the email to skate for Singapore in the 29th SEA Games held in Kuala Lumpur; the place where winter sports would be debuting in the region. Preparation toughened and the team was met with many difficulties. In the end, we managed to clinch the silver medal in the men’s 3000m relay.

  

I want to tell Lianhuarians that it is possible to achieve any dream or aspiration that you may have, even if the end goal may look impossible. If you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. As Wayne Gretzky once said: “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take”. Even if you lose while trying, the experiences and emotions gained from losing will push you harder to achieve success.
