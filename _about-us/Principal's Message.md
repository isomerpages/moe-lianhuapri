Dear Students, Parents, and Friends,

<p>Welcome to our school website! At Lianhua, we see every child as a superhero, equipped with unique talents and limitless potential to make a positive impact on the world. Our four school superheroes are supported by their loyal superpets, embodying vital executive functioning skills such as focus, organization, and self-management. Together, these dynamic duos shine brightly, achieving remarkable growth and showcasing their unique abilities.</p>

<p>Our approach is anchored in the principles of Play, Passion, and Purpose. Through purposeful play, we ignite curiosity and creativity. By nurturing passion, we foster resilience and excellence. With a strong sense of purpose, we empower students to direct their strengths toward meaningful contributions, shaping them into lifelong learners and changemakers.</p>

	
<p>At the heart of our mission is the vision to develop Passionate Learners, Critical and Creative Thinkers, Confident Communicators, and Exemplary Leaders. Supported by a team of dedicated educators, engaged parents, and our vibrant community, we are committed to equipping each Lianhua superhero with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to thrive in a dynamic and interconnected world.</p>	

<p>We look forward to partnering with parents and our community so that together, we bring out the best in every child in Lianhua. Together, let us unlock the superhero within every child and inspire them to reach for the stars.</p>


<p>Sincerely, <br>
Ms Pamela Kiew<br>
