Dear Students, Parents, and Friends,

<p>Welcome to our school website! We are excited to share our philosophy and approach to education with you. At Lianhua, we believe in nurturing passionate learners who are equipped with the skills needed to excel in an ever-evolving world. We endeavour to have a school where passion, critical thinking, creativity, and leadership thrive.</p>


<ol start="1" style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px">
		<li><p>As part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing the educational experience at Lianhua, we wanted to share an exciting development that aligns with our mission to cultivate not just academic excellence but also the holistic development of our students.</p></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px">
  <li><p>Starting this academic year, we have decided to <strong>name our classes after our core values</strong>. This decision is rooted in our belief that education goes beyond textbooks and exams; it is about shaping individuals who not only excel academically but also embody the values that are integral to our school community. We believe that this shift towards a values-based class naming approach will contribute significantly to the overall development of our students. It emphasizes our dedication to providing not just an excellent education but an education that shapes individuals with strong character and values.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Passionate Learners, Critical and Creative Thinkers</strong></p>
<ol start="3" style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px">
	<li><p>We are committed to cultivating a dynamic learning environment that nurtures critical and creative thinking skills among our students. Our lessons are designed to engage learners in thought-provoking discussions, authentic explorations, and collaborative projects that encourage them to analyze information critically and generate innovative solutions. Through platforms like our <strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in STEM, Robotics and Coding,</strong> we provide students with opportunities to apply their knowledge in practical, real-world contexts. </p></li>
	
<p>Additionally, we are excited to introduce our newly minted <strong>Innovation Week</strong>, a dedicated week where students can explore and unleash their creativity through multidisciplinary projects, interact with guest speakers, and showcase their innovative and creative endeavors. This initiative reflects our commitment to fostering a culture of curiosity, problem-solving, and continuous learning, pushing the boundaries of their imagination and problem-solving capabilities.</p>	
</ol>

<p><strong>Empowering Exemplary Leadership</strong></p>	
<ol start="4" style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px">
	<li><p>Our educational philosophy centers around nurturing students to first become leaders in their own lives. Through a unique focus on self-leadership, students develop the essential skills required for success in both academic and real-world settings. We believe that by instilling a sense of responsibility and self-motivation, our students will experience a transformative process that begins with self-leadership and extends to leading others and positively influencing their peers and communities. </p></li>
 

<p><strong>Unleashing the Superhero Within</strong></p>
	<li><p>Embracing the Superhero theme, we encourage our students to see themselves as everyday <strong>heroes capable of making a difference</strong>. Each student possesses unique strengths and talents that, when harnessed, contribute to the collective success of the school community. Our aim is to empower students to recognize and utilize their superpowers for personal growth and the betterment of others.</p></li>
	
<p><strong>Introducing our Superhero Sidekicks! - Executive Functioning Skills</strong></p>
	<li><p>In our commitment to providing a holistic education, we are excited to introduce our <strong>Superhero Sidekicks</strong>. These sidekicks symbolize the <strong>critical Executive Functioning Skills that are vital for effective learning and success</strong> in the 21st century. From time management to problem-solving, these sidekicks guide our students on their academic journey, helping them develop the skills necessary for lifelong success.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Confident Communication as a Cornerstone</strong></p>	
<ol start="7" style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px">
	<li><p>At Lianhua, we understand the importance of confident communication in leadership. Through various programs and activities, we emphasize the development of strong communication skills. We believe that effective leaders are not only articulate but also adept at active listening, collaboration, and expressing their ideas with clarity and conviction. These skills not only enhance academic performance but are crucial for success in future careers and life endeavors.</p></li>
</ol>
	
<p>As we embark on this exciting journey of self-discovery and leadership development, we invite our students to embrace their inner superheroes, recognize the significance of executive functioning skills, and understand the power of confident communication. Together, we are shaping leaders who will lead themselves well and make a positive impact in the lives of others.</p>

<p>We look forward to partnering with parents and our community so that together, we bring out the best in every child in Lianhua.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support.</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br>
Ms Pamela Kiew<br>
Principal<br>
Lianhua Primary School
