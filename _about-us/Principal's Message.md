Dear Students, Parents, and Friends,

<p>Welcome to our school website! </p>

<p>This year, Lianhua Primary School celebrates a very special milestone. Our <strong>80th Anniversary</strong> - the Oak Anniversary. This moment invites us to pause and reflect on the strong roots laid over decades, as we stretch purposefully towards the future. </p>

<p>Guided by our LH80 theme, <strong>“Rooted in Values, Growing with Purpose”</strong>, we look forward to a year of meaningful celebrations and the continued good work of striving towards our Vision, Mission and Values, and our desired student outcomes. These anchors keep us steady, focused, and united in nurturing passionate learners, critical and creative thinkers, confident communicators, and exemplary leaders.</p>

<p>This year also marks the introduction of our refreshed Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - <strong>Superhero Leaders</strong>, which focuses on developing students’ leadership, character, and sense of service to others. Alongside this, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in <strong>Robotics</strong> continues to provide authentic platforms for learning where students design, build, experiment, and apply their learning to real-world contexts.</p>

<p>Complementing these programmes is our newly established <strong>Makerspace and The Hangout</strong>, thoughtfully designed to ensure that our learning environment actively supports students’ curiosity, creativity, hands-on exploration and collaboration. Together, our programmes, platforms, and spaces work in synergy to develop critical thinking, collaboration, and strong ownership of learning in every child.</p>

<p>As we journey through this landmark year, I would like to thank all our parents, partners, alumni, community friends, and stakeholders for walking alongside us. Your trust, support, and belief in our children make all the difference.</p>

<p>We look forward to a fantastic year ahead. One that honours our past, strengthens our present, and grows our future with purpose.</p>
