<h1><strong>Parents Gateway (PG)</strong></h1>

<p>PG is a mobile app developed by MOE to support parents’ involvement in their child’s educational journey. The app enables you to receive information from the school and perform a range of administrative functions such as giving consent for school programmes and activities and declaring travel plans.</p>

<p>We encourage you to download PG on your mobile phone. Upon successful download, the app will guide you through a simple one-time onboarding process. You may search for ‘Parents Gateway’ mobile app or scan the QR code below. You will require SingPass login access.</p>
