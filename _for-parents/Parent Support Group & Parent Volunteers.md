## Purposes of Parent Support Group

Lianhua Primary School Parent Support Group(PSG) was formed by a group of parent volunteers who aims to create a positive relationship between the school and the parents. With the PSG vision of “ In unity,we care”, parent volunteers seeks opportunities to be part of school programs and events to care for the well-being of all students. With the PSG mission “ a pillar of strength working hand in hand with the school towards a better future”, parent volunteers support school in various activities and platforms, creating new learning experiences for all.

Our PSG has been true to their belief in making positive changes and building a culture of care in our school.

#### Helping out in school activities

Our committed PSG leaders and members came up with initiatives that never fails to amaze us. To celebrate 75th anniversary with LHPS family, they made paper strips out of old school magazines, breaking a Singapore record with our students and teachers. In the spirit of upcycling, Mdm Yong Karen taught the staff on handmade scrubs during SWC. Our PSG’s care and thoughtfulness for our students and other parents extends through their kind actions. It was a touching sight to see the smiles on our students and teachers’ faces when they helped in the various school activities.
