# Assessments Guidelines

The school conducts both weighted and non-weighted assessments to check for understanding and to use the information to support students in achieving the intended learning outcomes. The school draws reference from MOE’s Assessment-Feedback-Learning Cycle&nbsp;<sup>[1]</sup>.

Assessment is used for several purposes&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>:

Assessment information is shared with students to help both teachers and students monitor the progress of students’ learning and development. Teachers conduct these assessments to find out what students have learnt, provide them with feedback on learning gaps and their mastery of concepts, and improve teaching and learning. Information from these assessments also serves to provide a gauge of students' academic competencies and readiness for the next level of education. It is also shared with parents as part of the ongoing partnership in the students’ learning. With this feedback, parents can better guide, support and monitor their children’s learning.

Formative assessments are carried out as part of the ongoing teaching and learning in the classrooms. Primary 1 &amp; 2 students have mini tests each term as part of their Holistic Assessment (HA) which are non-weighted. In line with the National initiative to nurture our students to be lifelong learners who have stronger intrinsic motivation in learning, the school has removed all weighted assessments at Primary 1 &amp; 2. Qualitative descriptors will be used to report students’ learning progress.

Summative assessments namely Semestral Assessments for Primary 3, 4 and 5 are conducted in semester 2. Semestral Assessments are also used formatively to inform teachers of learning gaps to address.

  

The overall Assessment Weightings for all levels are reflected in the tables below:

**Table 1: Assessment Weightings for Core Subjects from P1 to P6**

| Level |  Term 1  |          Term 2         |  Term 3  |        Term 4        |

| P6   |    NWA   |         NWA        | 100% (Prelim) |          100% (PSLE)         |

NWA: Non-Weighted Assessment; WA: Weighted Assessment


**Absent from Examinations:**

**There is no make-up for examinations that students have missed.**

If a student is absent for any examination paper, he/she is required to submit a valid medical certificate to the form teacher when he/she returns to school. It will be reflected as ‘MC' in the report book.

If a student is absent for any examination paper and is unable to produce a valid medical certificate, it will be reflected as ‘AB' in the report book. He/She will get 0 marks for the paper. He/She will also not be considered for any academic-based awards.

Although marks are not computed, students will sit for the paper that they have missed when they return to school and feedback on their performance will be given.
