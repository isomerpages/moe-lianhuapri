# Superheroes Vision

Superheroes are awesome. Children and adults alike adore Superheroes and their stories–just look at the packed movie theatres every time a Marvel movie airs for proof.

  

At Lianhua, we believe that in each and every child, there is a superhero waiting to be uncovered. Every child has their own unique strengths and to help each child discover their hidden strengths and fulfill their potential, the CCE department has developed the ‘I’m A Superhero’ programme.

  

This programme gives all pupils of Lianhua the opportunity to be heroes in their everyday lives, enabling them to understand and believe that they too, can be Superheroes in their own way. We want all Lianhuareans to develop his/her inherent Superhero powers, harness their potential and find value and meaning in school.
