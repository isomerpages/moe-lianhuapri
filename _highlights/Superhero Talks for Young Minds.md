![](/images/Highlights/Superhero%20Talks/SuperheroTalk1.jpg)
	


<br>With the PSLE behind them, our Primary 6 students are stepping into an exciting new chapter of their educational journey. To foster their growth and curiosity, we recently hosted talks aimed at broadening their understanding of various industries and career paths, helping them envision the possibilities that lie ahead.
<br><br>
During these sessions, the P6 students gained insights into professions they may not have previously encountered. Designed to inspire and expand their perspectives, these talks encouraged them to explore their passions and make informed decisions about their futures. <br><br>
The interactive format and inspiring personal stories offered students a glimpse into the real world. Regardless of their future aspirations, these discussions serve as a valuable stepping stone in discovering their potential. The future is full of opportunities, and we’re thrilled to support them in exploring their unique paths!<br><br>
A heartfelt thank you to our inspiring speakers:<br>
Ms. Felicia Chua Hwee Khim from Ventured Pte Ltd<br>
Ms. Kimberly Quek from Dyson<br>
Mr. Koay Teong Beng from the Acoustic Research Laboratory (NUS)<br>
Let’s continue to empower our young minds to think big and dream even bigger!
