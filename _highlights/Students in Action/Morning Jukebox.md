# Morning Jukebox

<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Morning Jukebox’ is a new programme launched by our Music Department, which replaces the pre-assembly mass singing we used to have on Fridays in the school hall prior to Covid-19.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Different student DJs take turns hosting the ‘Morning Jukebox’ for each session. They play the songs composed by their schoolmates through the programme developed by the music department. The songs that are played are aligned with the school value of each month, as well as songs that are meant for different festivals or occasions. In addition, our DJs conduct interview sessions with the school leaders and teachers.</p>


#### Students' Voices ####

I enjoyed being a student deejay with my classmate, Hardy Irfan in the Morning Jukebox segment. I think it is a great opportunity for students to participate in Morning Jukebox as student deejays or interviewers. Personally, through the preparation process, I developed the values of Diligence and resilience. This was because I had to rehearse a number of times with my partner before we managed to deliver a well-rehearsed piece during the recording session. I hope I will be able to have more opportunities like this when I am in secondary school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I was delighted to be interviewed by my classmate, Gautami, in Morning Jukebox. I was in a state of euphoria as I played the Chinese flute, Dizi. It was as though I was free from all the troubles that were impeding me! I had acquired the values of resilience and diligence as I did not learn to play the Chinese flute well overnight. It took me many hours of practice to master the technique of playing the instrument. I had a sense of achievement when I performed well during the recording session.

I was hesitant when I was selected by Mrs Tay to be the student deejay for Morning Jukebox. I was not an eloquent speaker nor did I have the confidence to speak in front of the camera. After much consideration, I agreed to it as I thought it would be a good learning experience. Due to the safe distancing measures, Mrs Tay rehearsed the script with me via Zoom. Throughout the Zoom sessions, Mrs Tay taught me important tips and tricks to speak well and be confident. Not long after, it was time to record the video. I felt that my recording was decent and my speaking skills had improved significantly. I hope that the school can provide more opportunities like this to more students to build up their confidence.&nbsp;

I was excited yet nervous when I was rehearsing the script with my classmate, Krystabelle, for a number of times. I faced my fear of having to speak in front of the camera with the support of my friends, who cheered me up and I felt confident after some time. I was proud of myself for not giving up easily when I encountered difficulties with the pronunciation of some words.&nbsp;
