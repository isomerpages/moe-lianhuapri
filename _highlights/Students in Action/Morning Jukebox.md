# Morning Jukebox

‘Morning Jukebox’ is a new programme launched by our Music Department, which replaces the pre-assembly mass singing we used to have on Fridays in the school hall prior to Covid-19.


Different student DJs take turns hosting the ‘Morning Jukebox’ for each session. They play the songs composed by their schoolmates through the programme developed by the music department. The songs that are played are aligned with the school value of each month, as well as songs that are meant for different festivals or occasions. In addition, our DJs conduct interview sessions with the school leaders and teachers.


Below are the reflections of some of our student DJs:


I felt nervous but happy to be able to participate as a student DJ. I practised in front of the mirror, reading out the script over and over again, with expression. I learned to be resilient and not to give up so easily. I realised I had become more confident after the video-recording.

**ZARA ALLIE HAYLEYANA BINTI MOHAMMAD FIRDAUS – 6 Loyalty**

My experience being a student DJ for the Morning Jukebox was quite enjoyable. The teachers helped and guided me on the rehearsing of the script and also during the filming. They also provided me with encouragement so I was more confident. I am grateful to the teachers and will apply what I have learned in my future endeavours.

**SOPHIA ROSE TAN – 6 Diligence**

I was filled with excitement to have the opportunity to appear on screen before the whole school. Although I was nervous during the video-recording, I plucked up the courage to complete my task of being a student DJ. I would like to thank my teachers and friends for giving me their full support.

**CHINDARAT ARCHITA ANTHONY YIP – 6 Excellence**

I had a lot of fun being a DJ for Morning Jukebox. Prior to that, I had a few rehearsals with Mrs Tay during recess. I also had a lot of practice at home. I realised the importance of being diligent and showing resilience during the process.

**ANGGUN QAISARA BINTE MOHAMED NORISHAM – 6 Compassion**

The whole experience had helped me to improve my verbal expression and I gained confidence. The effort that I had put in was worth it as I was satisfied when I saw myself in the video. I am very grateful for the opportunity given to me.

**PALANIAPPAN ABISHEK PRIYAN – 6 Resilience**
