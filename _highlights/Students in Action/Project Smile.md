<p style="text-align: justify;">“There are many reasons why we join Project SMILE but the most obvious reason is that we can help the needy families in the school as well as in the community. In this way, we can brighten up the world.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, this is the positive attitude that our students have whenever they volunteer for this meaningful project.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Project SMILE is a project where Lianhua partners many agencies with the aim of bringing smiles to people who are facing difficult situations. Working in partnership with Hao Ren Hao Shi* and the Bukit Gombak Hillgrove Residents’ Committee, the school staff and students pack and distribute grocery packs to vulnerable families of the school and the community.</p>
