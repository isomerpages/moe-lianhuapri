Indeed, this is the positive attitude that our students have whenever they volunteer for this meaningful project.

  

Project SMILE is a project where Lianhua partners many agencies with the aim of bringing smiles to people who are facing difficult situations. Working in partnership with Hao Ren Hao Shi\* and the Bukit Gombak Hillgrove Residents’ Committee, the school staff and students pack and distribute grocery packs to vulnerable families of the school and the community.
