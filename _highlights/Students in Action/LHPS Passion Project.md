# LHPS Passion Project

## <center>Creating a Generation of Passionately Curious Learners</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lianhua Primary School’s Passion Project was designed in 2019 with the aim of igniting our students’ curiosity and motivation to learn. Through the project, students are able to participate in not just joyful, but meaningful, learning experiences. They are challenged to pursue their passions and to be confident to lead their life purposefully. At the same time, they are taught to think about social and environmental issues around them and to be the young activists to address these issues. They learn that they, as young as they may be, can also make a difference to the world around them. The school believes that it is important to teach the kids to learn for life so that they can become healthy, happy and successful kids in life. In 2020, the school’s motto was changed to ‘Play, Passion, Purpose’ to reflect this thinking and ideal.</p>

**Passion at the Heart of Learning**

Our Passion Project is a student-centric tool which encourages the students to be curious of their likes, strengths and sources of motivation. Through this project, every child is given the opportunity to learn by exploring their interests and discovering their passions. Through play, our students will experience different domains of learning, which include technology, arts, music, sports, nature, dance, languages and even mathematics.<br clear="left">

Making use of their new-found passions, our pupils are then challenged to go on a deep learning journey and to inspire others by sharing their passion and journey. These challenges build the child’s resilience and confidence.
