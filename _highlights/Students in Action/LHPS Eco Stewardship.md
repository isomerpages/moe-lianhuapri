# LHPS Eco Stewardship

## <u>Introduction</u>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lianhua primary school prides itself as one of the schools which has a wide range of flora and fauna while surrounded by beautiful scenery–mainly due to the Bukit Batok Town Park and Little Guilin. We have four fish ponds and three gardens that host more than 20 species of fishes and organisms for the learning of Science and are frequently used for PAL (outdoor education) lessons.</p>

## Edible Garden

The edible garden situated on the second floor is used often by teachers, staff and parent volunteers to plant vegetables and edible herbs. In addition, we have two large worm composting bins armed with blue Malayan nightcrawlers to compost organic waste and water lettuce that sometimes overpopulates the school ponds. The compost will then be used to fertilise the many fruit trees on our premises (Papaya trees, Chiku tree, Custard apple tree, Soursop tree, Lime plant, Mango tree and Guava tree). The wide variety of flowers in the gardens also benefit from this composting of food waste as they provide them with the necessary minerals and nutrients.

## Green Super Heroes

We are fortunate to have a group of students and teachers who are passionate about improving our school gardens. They work tirelessly during the weekday afternoons and even on Saturdays to improve and maintain our school gardens.

## Lianhua Primary School’s Green Commitment

Lianhua Primary School has been participating in the Green Schools @ Southwest annually. Being an enthusiastic supporter of the green movement, Lianhua’s efforts have paid off as the school has attained Gold Award for almost all the years that it has participated in this programme and thus has also achieved the Sustained Gold award.

Besides that, the school also participated in the School Green Audit Award organised by the Singapore Environment Council. It has attained a Palm award and an Orchid award respectively during the two years when it took part in the audit. For the Community in Bloom Awards, we have also achieved a Gold award for our Learning Garden.

## School Wide Sustainability Awareness & Education

The school has a structured framework where the students from Primary 1 to Primary 6 will be educated by their Form Teachers on a different environmental topic each year.

The school also tapped on programmes by NEA like the Buddy Clean Workshop and Green Schools @ Southwest to empower our students.

Form teachers also conduct other environmental awareness programmes, e.g. Youth for the Environment Observance Activities where our students were educated about issues like reducing disposables and food waste.

Our students are also actively involved in environmental sustainability themed VIA projects annually like our Dengue Mobster outreach where students go to the community to educate the residents about dengue prevention. They also carry out litter-picking around our neighbourhood and the nearby nature parks. This project educates participants on the importance of environmental protection through their involvement in clearing litter in the neighbourhood. They learn the importance of keeping school and public toilets clean through the cleaning of the school toilets. Through these activities, they also learnt to appreciate our school attendants more. To show their appreciation to our school attendants, our students make cards to thank them for their hard work.
