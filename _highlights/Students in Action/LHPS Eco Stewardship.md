# LHPS Eco Stewardship

## <u>Introduction</u>

Lianhua primary school prides itself as one of the schools which has a wide range of flora and fauna while surrounded by beautiful sceneryâ€“mainly due to the Bukit Batok Town Park and Little Guilin. We have four fish ponds and three gardens that host more than 20 species of fishes and organisms for the learning of Science and are frequently used for PAL (outdoor education) lessons.
