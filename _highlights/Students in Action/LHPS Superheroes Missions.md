<p style="text-align: justify;">Our school is dedicated to nurturing compassionate and responsible citizens through its community service initiatives. The school’s Values-in-Action (VIA) programme focuses on instilling a sense of empathy, social responsibility and a strong sense of volunteerism in our students. By engaging in meaningful projects that address the needs of the local and wider community, students learn the importance of contributing to society. These initiatives aim to develop students’ character, foster teamwork, and inspire them to make a positive impact on the community they live in, ultimately bringing out their hearts of service and commitment to others. It is our hope that our students will learn to make positive impacts around them and become the superheroes of our nation.</p>	
	
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u><strong>Project SMILE</strong></u><br>The act of voluntarism can be said to be the fruit of CCE at Lianhua. It encapsulates our school’s motto ‘Play, Passion, Purpose’, as well as our school’s mission. In Project SMILE, our goal is to bring smiles to the families in need in the community. Students and parents are invited to participate in our monthly grocery distribution, in partnership with Hao Ren Hao Shi.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I joined Project Smile because I want to help other people who are in need. When everyone works together as a team, they can combine their strengths, skills, and ideas. This effort leads to better outcomes than what each person could achieve alone. I felt happy and satisfied working together with other friends and make new friends. At the same time, I am doing good deed too.</i></p><p style="text-align: right;"><i>~Irdina, 3 Compassion 4</i></p>

In line with our National Day celebration, our school embarked on a heartwarming initiative to contribute to the Hao Ren Hao Shi Project, a cause dedicated to supporting the needy in our community. With a focus on compassion and resilience, students were encouraged to bring Milo powder packets from home as part of our collective effort to make a difference.<br><br>This project, led by our dedicated student leaders, aimed to instill the values of kindness and empathy in our students. Through this simple yet meaningful act of giving, our students learned that even small contributions can have a significant impact on those in need.<br><br>2033 Milo packets were collected from the students, staff, parents, and the Hillgrove RC. They were then donated to the Hao Ren Hao Shi Project, which will help provide nourishment to individuals and families who require support. This initiative not only provided a valuable lesson in service and compassion but also strengthened the bond within our school community as we worked together towards a common goal.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We are proud of our students for their enthusiastic participation and for embodying the spirit of giving. This initiative has reminded us all that kindness and care are powerful tools that can bring hope and comfort to those around us. Well done, Lianhua!</p>

Not only that, the children get to learn more about helping and apply values such as compassion. Next time, maybe we can have the children donate other items such as daily necessities. If every single school in Singapore does that, our country will become a more compassionate country. I will definitely recommend that others to join this project as well!</i></p><p style="text-align: right">Divyameenatchi.T, 5 Unity 3</p></td>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><u>PTC Care Ride Project</u></strong><br>On 18 October 2024, a group of Lianhua students participated in the Care Ride Project, in collaboration with the Public Transport Council. Led by the class form teacher, Ms Gracia Ee, the students went on a trip with a group of elderlies to Tengah Bus Interchange. During the project, the students mingled with the elderlies and learnt to take care of their needs such as ensuring they have a seat on the public bus and helping them to carry their belongings. The students learnt to be a young caring commuter. Such meaningful experiences will help Singapore to build a caring and inclusive community.</p>
