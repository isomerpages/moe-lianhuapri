<p style="text-align: justify">Our school is dedicated to nurturing compassionate and responsible citizens through its community service initiatives. The school’s Values-in-Action (VIA) programme focuses on instilling a sense of empathy, social responsibility and a strong sense of volunteerism in our students. By engaging in meaningful projects that address the needs of the local and wider community, students learn the importance of contributing to society. These initiatives aim to develop students’ character, foster teamwork, and inspire them to make a positive impact on the community they live in, ultimately bringing out their hearts of service and commitment to others. It is our hope that our students will learn to make positive impacts around them and become the superheroes of our nation.</p>	
	
<p style="text-align: justify"><u><strong>Project SMILE</strong></u><br>The act of voluntarism can be said to be the fruit of CCE at Lianhua. It encapsulates our school’s motto ‘Play, Passion, Purpose’, as well as our school’s mission. In Project SMILE, our goal is to bring smiles to the families in need in the community. Students and parents are invited to participate in our monthly grocery distribution, in partnership with Hao Ren Hao Shi.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>I joined Project Smile because I want to help other people who are in need. When everyone works together as a team, they can combine their strengths, skills, and ideas. This effort leads to better outcomes than what each person could achieve alone. I felt happy and satisfied working together with other friends and make new friends. At the same time, I am doing good deed too.</i></p><p style="text-align: right;"><i>~Irdina, 3 Compassion 4</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>I learnt about Project Smile from my scout’s teacher. My greatest joy comes from offering support and assist others especially the elderly. I also learnt that by working together, we can create a ripple effect of kindness, one small act at a time. If given an opportunity, I would like to create a corner in school where everyone can donate their groceries item which can then be given out during Project Smile. </i></p><p style="text-align: right;"><i>~Anne Kamalini, 6 Resilience 4</i></p>

With a focus on compassion and resilience, students were encouraged to bring Milo powder packets from home as part of our collective effort to make a difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2033 Milo packets were collected from the students, staff, parents, and the Hillgrove RC. They were then donated to the Hao Ren Hao Shi Project, which will help provide nourishment to individuals and families who require support. This initiative not only provided a valuable lesson in service and compassion but also strengthened the bond within our school community as we worked together towards a common goal.</p>
