<p>Our school is dedicated to nurturing compassionate and responsible citizens through its community service initiatives. The school’s Values-in-Action (VIA) programme focuses on instilling a sense of empathy, social responsibility and a strong sense of volunteerism in our students. By engaging in meaningful projects that address the needs of the local and wider community, students learn the importance of contributing to society. These initiatives aim to develop students’ character, foster teamwork, and inspire them to make a positive impact on the community they live in, ultimately bringing out their hearts of service and commitment to others. It is our hope that our students will learn to make positive impacts around them and become the superheroes of our nation.</p>
