<p><strong>Superhero Leaders Programme</strong>
<br><em>Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Unleashing the Hero Within Every Student</strong>
<br>Our Superhero Leaders Programme transforms every Lianhua student into
an exemplary leader who makes a real difference in their community. We
believe every child has the potential to be a superhero – not with capes
and superpowers, but with character, compassion, and courage.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes a Superhero Leader?</strong>
<br>Our programme develops students who excel in four key areas:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Excellence</strong> Students become self-disciplined individuals
with strong character who embrace active, healthy lifestyles and take charge
of their own growth.</p>
<p><strong>Communication &amp; Innovation</strong> Our young leaders master
effective communication, thrive in collaborative environments, and approach
challenges with adaptive and inventive thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Community Service</strong> They develop a genuine heart for service,
understanding others' needs and taking meaningful action to improve their
school, environment, and wider community.</p>
<p><strong>Social Impact</strong> Our Superhero Leaders exercise social responsibility
within their spheres of influence, making purposeful contributions that
create lasting positive change.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership in Action</strong>
<br>Every student has opportunities to step up and lead through various meaningful
roles:
<br>• <strong>Class Leaders</strong> who guide their peers daily
<br>• <strong>CCA Leaders</strong> who inspire excellence in co-curricular activities
<br>• <strong>Peer Support Leaders</strong> who care for fellow students
<br>• <strong>Prefects</strong> who serve as role models for the entire school</p>
<p><strong>Real-World Leadership Development</strong>
<br>Through CCAs and our exciting Primary 5 Adventure &amp; Leadership Camp,
students don't just learn about leadership – they live it. These experiences
allow them to apply leadership skills, develop self-management abilities,
embrace values of unity and resilience, and master the art of teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>The TERA Approach</strong>
<br>Our Superhero Leaders follow a proven development cycle:
<br>• <strong>Think</strong> critically about challenges and opportunities
<br>• <strong>Experience</strong> hands-on leadership situations
<br>• <strong>Reflect</strong> on lessons learned and growth achieved
<br>• <strong>Act</strong> with purpose to create positive impact</p>

<p><strong>Built on Proven Leadership Principles</strong>
<br>Our programme is grounded in Kouzes and Posner's Five Practices of Exemplary
Leadership. Students at Tier 2 (Lead Others) develop mastery through:
<br><strong>Model the Way </strong>– Leading by example with integrity and
authenticity
<br><strong>Inspire a Shared Vision</strong> – Creating compelling futures
that motivate others
<br><strong>Challenge the Process</strong> – Seeking innovative solutions and
taking smart risks
<br><strong>Enable Others to Act</strong> – Fostering collaboration and strengthening
others
<br><strong>Encourage the Heart</strong> – Recognising contributions and celebrating
achievements</p>

our Grow Well SG approach: Eat Well, Sleep Well, Exercise Well, Learn Well,
Bond Well.
<br>From classroom initiatives to school-wide projects and community outreach,
our students have countless platforms to initiate change, lead others,
and spearhead meaningful initiatives. The diagram below illustrates the
