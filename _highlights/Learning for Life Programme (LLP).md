**Values and Attributes**

Taking reference from the Game for Life Framework (Sport Singapore, 2013), some core values and attributes are identified and selected for Primary One to Six levels. CHAMP for Life aims to equip students with a broad spectrum of values and attributes from three categories:

1. Performance: necessary for effective skill learning and execution.

2. Social: establishing strong relationship dynamics between all parties, for example team members, opponents, as well as sport officials.

3. Moral: moderating desire for success with a sense of righteousness.

**Tiered Approach**

A tiered approach serves to provide students with different depths of experience. CHAMP for Life consists of two tiers.

**Tier One**

Students will learn and apply selected values through the Physical Education (PE) curriculum and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) modules. The CHAMP for Life journal is used to facilitate reflections and allow students to document their learning.

The range of programmes include:

*   Values-infused PE lessons
    
*   Step-It-Up Challenge (Recess Programme)
    
*   Inter-Class Games
    
*   Key PE events like Sports Day and cohort camps
    
*   Sports Education Programme

*   PAL (Sports &amp; Games and Outdoor Education) modules

**Tier Two**

The target group is the Sports CCA members, and the focus is on the application of values like sportsmanship and excellence at both recreational and competitive levels. There will also be opportunities for students to hone leadership skills so that they can contribute to various roles during CCA or school-wide sports events. Some of the opportunities include:

*   P1 CCA Experience
    
*   Officials for Sports Day and Inter-Class Games
    
*   Student facilitators for cohort camps

**CHAMP for Life journal**

The CHAMP for Life journal has been designed to assist PE teachers in the explicit teaching of values-infused PE lessons and experiences via the two-tiered approach. The journal also offers opportunities for students to cultivate values through reflecting on school sporting and outdoor experiences. Reflection encourages students to look within to consider how they are truly feeling about a situation or activity.

Through active learning strategies, teachers spend more time promoting learning that facilitates deep understanding and acquisition of skills. The benefits of using such strategies include enhanced critical thinking skills, increased motivation and improved interpersonal skills.
