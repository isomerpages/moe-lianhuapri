**Values and Attributes**

Taking reference from the Game for Life Framework (Sport Singapore, 2013), some core values and attributes are identified and selected for Primary One to Six levels. CHAMP for Life aims to equip students with a broad spectrum of values and attributes from three categories:

1. Performance: necessary for effective skill learning and execution.

2. Social: establishing strong relationship dynamics between all parties, for example team members, opponents, as well as sport officials.

3. Moral: moderating desire for success with a sense of righteousness.

**Tiered Approach**

A tiered approach serves to provide students with different depths of experience. CHAMP for Life consists of two tiers.

The range of programmes include:

*   Values-infused PE lessons
    
*   Step-It-Up Challenge (Recess Programme)
    
*   Inter-Class Games

Values are the rules by which we choose to live our lives. They serve as an internal compass to help us set priorities and guide us in the right direction. When we align our choices and actions to the right values, we cultivate a positive attitude and become more equipped to handle life’s various challenges.
