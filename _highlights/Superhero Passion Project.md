<h3><strong>Passion Project</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">The <strong>Passion Project</strong> at LHPS is an engaging and dynamic initiative designed to inspire students to explore their unique interests, talents, and curiosities. Through this program, students are encouraged to take ownership of their learning by selecting and working on a project that aligns with their personal passions, whether related to a hobby, a cause, a career aspiration, or a field of study they are particularly interested in. The essence of the Passion Project is to empower students to immerse themselves in something they care deeply about, allowing them to learn in a way that is both meaningful and personal.
<br><br>
The project kicks off during the June holidays, allowing students to explore their passions and share their discoveries by uploading a video on Padlet. After the holidays, selected students will return to present and share their experiences with their peers.
<br><br>
The Passion Project at LHPS is not solely focused on the final product, but rather on the journey of exploration, creativity, and personal growth. As they engage with their chosen topic, students not only deepen their knowledge but also develop critical skills such as perseverance, problem-solving, and creative thinking. The program encourages students to reflect on who they are, what they care about, and how they can make a meaningful impact on the world around them.
