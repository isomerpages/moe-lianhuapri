<h2><strong>Superhero Acts Challenge</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i><u>Objective</u></i><br>
The challenge constituted of LHPS studentsâ€™ daily behaviour in their respective classes, their ability to demonstrate positive executive functioning, their punctuality, their attire and how they exhibit values in school. Specific tasks like cleanliness in class, Step-It-Up and readership make up the other integral aspects of how students display collective efforts as a class to gain points. LHPS Superhero Acts Point system provides an objective and fair way to assess the students, allowing teachers to recognise and celebrate the diverse strengths of our students. Through the points system, we wish to place a strong emphasis on collaboration, shared responsibility, and community building. We wish to develop in them a deep appreciation for the power of collective effort in their Lianhuareans' educational journey.
