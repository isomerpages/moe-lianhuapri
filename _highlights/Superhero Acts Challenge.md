<h2><strong>Superhero Acts Challenge</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i><u>Objective</u></i><br>
The challenge constituted of LHPS students’ daily behaviour in their respective classes, their ability to demonstrate positive executive functioning, their punctuality, their attire and how they exhibit values in school. Specific tasks like cleanliness in class, Step-It-Up and readership make up the other integral aspects of how students display collective efforts as a class to gain points. LHPS Superhero Acts Point system provides an objective and fair way to assess the students, allowing teachers to recognise and celebrate the diverse strengths of our students. Through the points system, we wish to place a strong emphasis on collaboration, shared responsibility, and community building. We wish to develop in them a deep appreciation for the power of collective effort in their Lianhuareans' educational journey.

<p style="text-align: justify"><i><u>LHPS Golden Ticket!</u></i><br>
Inspired by the magical world of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, our Golden Ticket system is designed to celebrate and reinforce positive behaviour in LHPS. 
Just like in the beloved story, students have the chance to earn coveted golden tickets for demonstrating exceptional behaviour and executive functioning skills. LHPS Superhero Acts Golden Tickets are special and rare, just like the ones in the whimsical and imaginative world of Willy Wonka's factory. Winning a golden ticket entitles a student to a little reward for his/her exceptional behaviour. Our Golden Ticket system isn't just about rewards—it's about fostering a positive learning environment where students are motivated to excel and support one another! 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Class Champion</i><br>
Class Champion for each level per term adds an element of friendly rivalry and competition between the classes in the same level. It gives students a common goal to strive for and helps to build class spirit. The anticipation of becoming the champion class in their level motivates the students to perform well.<br><br>
As a token of our appreciation for their remarkable achievements, champion classes get to receive special privileges to enjoy an arcade-themed recess. Imagine the excitement as they play classic arcade games like Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and table soccer right here on our school grounds! But that's not all - to spread the joy and inclusivity, every student from champion classes will also have the opportunity to invite a friend from another class to join in the arcade fun! This gesture of inclusivity and friendship reflects the values of kindness and camaraderie that we hold dear at our school. 
<br><br>
We believe that the points system will not only add an extra layer of friendly competition among classes but also reinforce important values that we strive to instill in our students.
We are also thrilled to celebrate the achievements of our Golden Ticket winners through our points system. Taking back a little gift and the Golden ticket is a testament to their hard work, dedication, and positive attitude.
Congratulations once again!
<br><br>
	We hope we have made the tickets so visually striking and highly coveted items that LHPS students will be motivated to exhibit positive behaviour throughout the school day. Our Golden Ticket system isn't just about rewards—it's about fostering a positive learning environment where students are motivated to excel and support one another! 
Stay tuned for updates and golden ticket sightings! It's going to be an adventure-filled year as we embark on this wonderful journey together!
