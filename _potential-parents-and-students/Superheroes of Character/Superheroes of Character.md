            <td><strong></strong><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ang Yi Qin (1 Diligence 5)</strong><br>
Ang Yi Qin helped to look after a classmate daily. During PE lessons, she would take very good care of this classmate and even try to guide him to do simple PE tasks such as rolling, throwing and catching. With her passionate help, this child enjoys attending PE classes. Yi Qin sacrificed the opportunity to play with her other friends to help this classmate of hers and she did it so willingly. Yi Qin has consistently shown compassion towards her other classmates by helping readily. She shows patience when dealing with some of her classmates who are resistant to her helpful efforts and remains determined to help them. When providing aid, she does so in a subtle manner and never seeks to draw attention to her deeds, nor glorify her efforts. She is a positive role model for her peers, despite her young age.</p>

            <td><strong></strong><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Suresh Jaanvi (6 Resilience 4)</strong><br>
Jaanvi is very passionate in her mission to clean up the environment. It started in Primary 2 when she volunteered for the Marine Conservation Project, a school-based environmental project. Her parents were her strongest supporters as they would go to the beach to pick up litters. In 2023, she took part in the Nature Guides’ litter picking project at the beach. After the project, with the encouragement from teachers like Ms Pauline Lee, Ms Edelyn Lee and Ms Shafira, she invited a group of friends for 2 litter picking activities on their own (Bukit Timah hill and Rail Corridor). They had a rich experience, walking many kilometers and picking up many litters, even encountering curious and potentially dangerous monkeys along the way. Even with the PSLE examinations around the corner, she has started her planning on organizing more litter picking projects with her peers after the examinations.</p>
