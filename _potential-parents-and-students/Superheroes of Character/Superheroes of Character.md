<h2><strong>Superheroes of Character</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify"> Our Superheroes of Character are students who have exemplified the values of our school through their daily lives. These students have been nominated by their teachers and endorsed by an interviewing panel. As Ghandhi once said,</p>
