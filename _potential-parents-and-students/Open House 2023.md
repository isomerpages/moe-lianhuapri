# Open House 2023

Lianhua Primary School was buzzing with an almost carnival-like atmosphere last Saturday morning as the school held its first physical Open House.

Parents with children entering Primary One in 2024 excitedly embarked on A Superhero Quest to learn more about the school programmes by going on a trail. From academic to non-academic programmes, parents were exposed to a variety of school-led initiatives that develops the child holistically.

Parents were also given a peek into how their own children might turn out after being in Lianhua as the various stations showcasing the school programmes were hosted by current students themselves. The student facilitators were able to share their personal experiences in Lianhua, providing a firsthand account.

Last but not least, a big thank you to all who graced our Open House and gave us the opportunity to share what being a Lianhuarean is all about.
