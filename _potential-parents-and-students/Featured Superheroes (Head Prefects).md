    <td>ANDREA CHANDRA PUTRI<br>(2015/2016)</td>
    <td>Being in Lianhua was very enriching and I have learnt so much from my 6 years here. I've had the honour of serving the school many times, be it representing the school in various events or being the head prefect. These experiences have made me who I am today and I am very thankful for them. One experience I particularly remember was the first time I was asked to help with flag-raising just minutes before assembly started and I was so unprepared that I didn't manage to keep my sling pouch and ended up carrying it while flag-raising!</td>

    <td>As the Head Prefect of 2017, it gave me a lot of opportunities to learn and grow as a leader.To me the whole journey as a Head prefect was memorable.Many events have helped nurture me in becoming a better leader.Like Teacher’s day,we were told to be the emcees for the event but on the day of rehearsal, we prepared nothing and sitting around waiting for instructions.We were reprimanded but the teachers taught me one of the most important value as a leader,which is to be proactive.To take the initiative to do something and not just sit around doing nothing.<br><br>Although there were many ups and downs during the process,it was all worthwhile.The guidance and support they have given me was really priceless and most importantly,it made me realise what it really means to be a leader.It is not a tittle and fame, it is sense of responsibility of having the role.</td>

    <td>VO TRI TAI<br>(2017/2018)</td>
    <td>I had an amazing experience in LHPS. From caring friends to friendly Teachers, they all have contributed to the amazing experience that I have. They have made adapting to a new environment much easier for me. Throughout my 3 years, LHPS had provided me with plentiful opportunities to serve the school. Such opportunities include Teachers’ Day planning and volunteering activities such as festive giving and CNY celebration with Renci. All of these would not be possible without the help of my fellow peers and core team members. One memorable incident that happened was when I quarrelled with my fellow core team member Kerlin over a problem that a primary one was facing because of our different views. The quarrel got serious to the point we both ended up crying. From that experience I learnt to remain calm and consider others’ point of view. We eventually talked it out and knew what went wrong. Our friendship deepened after that incident. </td>

    <td>ANKIT RATHI<br>(2018/2019)</td>
    <td>Being in LHPS for 6 years, I’ve had so many amazing experiences and have grown so much. Starting all the way back in Primary 1, I used to hate coming to school, but my teachers and friends motivated me and helped me by making my school experience much more enjoyable in the early years. After I became a prefect in Primary 3, I immediately felt a sense of responsibility and took on my role with pride. As a prefect, I became more confident, but most importantly,  I learnt the importance of being proactive as a servant leader. From that year, I started to volunteer for initiatives such as the Running Hour, P-Love and Solar Buddy. From participating in these, I realised how fruitful and satisfying it is to be able to help others, which led me to start my first initiative in Primary 4 with some fellow prefects, the Freecycle Project. We collected used school items at the end of the year, carried out a process of sorting and recycling and then put them up for all students to take, and also to donate to the Salvation Army. This experience of carrying out my own initiative then led up to becoming part of the core team, and then, Head Prefect. This was by far the biggest achievement of mine in LHPS, providing me the opportunity to serve others in the school and the community through projects like the interactions on CNY with the elderly at Renci, and at the same time, grow as a person and as a leader. Now as a prefect in my secondary school, I hope to display and develop the values and virtues I have learnt from LHPS, from my inspiring teachers and fellow peers. </td>

    <td>JUSTIN HO GUAN XIAN<br>(2019/2020)</td>
    <td>Hi! I am Justin, past head prefect of Lianhua Primary School for the 2019 and 2020 batch. I am glad to have served the school to the utmost of my abilities when I was the head prefect. I remember that in 2020, during the first half of year, the core team decided together that we would do a project, called Care Packs, where we collected non-perishable food items that teachers and staff donated, and put them into packs for the needy people living in the neighbourhood across our school, as more people needed help during the COVID pandemic. It was an enriching experience that I will never forget.<br><br>During my 6 years of studying in Lianhua Primary School, I have made many good friends and awesome memories. I have learnt so much from teachers, staff and schoolmates. Overall, it was really enjoyable and the teachers made learning as engaging as possible.</td>

    <td>TAN EMMA XIN PING<br>(2020/2021)</td>
    <td>Hello! I am Emma, the ex head prefect from 2020 in Lianhua Primary School. During these past six years in Lianhua l  have learned so much from the teachers and have gained a lot of amazing experiences. The teachers in Lianhua Primary have given me so many opportunities to flourish and to sharpen my leadership skills. I am very thankful for the teachers who have been guiding me and helping me to grow over the last 6 years. One of the memorable experiences that I will never forget is working together with the core team, teachers and the staff in the school to participate in the Smile project. To bring smiles to the students in need in school. I remember the teachers used to tell us during the prefect meeting “ A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions and the compassion to listen to others. He does not set out to be a leader, but becomes one by the quality of his actions and the integrity of his intent’.I would always hold that in my mind and continue to  do good for the school and to encourage others in the school to do the same. Even though I faced some challenges along the way, I knew that with the teachers’ help and the core team’s support, I could overcome any obstacles that came my way. Working with the core team also reminded me what true unity really was. Lianhua primary school really has brought me a lot of memories that I can reminisce about and inspire othersI will continue to stand tall and reach greater heights!</td>

    <td>PHANG WEI XUAN<br>(2021-2022)</td>
    <td>Being the head prefect from 2021 to 2022 has been incredibly rewarding. It was filled with meaningful experiences and opportunities for growth. As Head Prefect, l had the chance to lead and contribute to our school community in various ways. One of my most memorable experiences was planning for Teachers’ Day. Organizing that event allowed me to work closely with the core team to show our appreciation to our teachers who have guided and supported us. It was a joy to see our plans come to life and to witness the teachers' smiles and enjoyment during the day. Additionally, I had the privilege of leading Project Smile, a heartwarming initiative where the school arranged for essential groceries and necessities to the elderly and families in need. Coordinating this project was both challenging and deeply fulfilling. Seeing the positive impact we could make in our community was incredibly inspiring. These experiences have taught me valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and compassion. I am grateful for all the opportunities LHPS has provided me to grow into who I am now.</td>

</td>
    <td>As the Head Prefect in Lianhua Primary School from 2022 to 2023, I had the privilege of leading by example and fostering a positive environment for my fellow students. I organized various school events, promoted discipline, and supported my peers in their academic and personal endeavors. It was a rewarding experience that taught me valuable leadership skills and the importance of teamwork. Now, in my secondary school, I look back on those days with fondness, cherishing the memories and lessons that have shaped me into the student I am today. Not long after my graduation, I was invited to speak to my juniors in Lianhua. I am very glad to be able to further contribute to Lianhua as an alumni, to connect with them and share my experience as a secondary school student. I am inspired to continue my leadership journey and to be a role model to my juniors.</td>
