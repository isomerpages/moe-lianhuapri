			<td>WOO JIA JIE<br>(2024-2025)</td>
			<td>It is with immense gratitude and humility that I reflect on my time as Head Prefect of Lianhua 2024-2025. Serving in this role has been one of the greatest honours of my life, and I am deeply thankful for the trust and support that have been extended to me throughout this journey. As I look back on the years I have spent in Lianhua, I am reminded of the countless lessons I have learned, the challenges I have faced, and the growth I have experienced—all of which have shaped me into the person I am today.<br>
I vividly recall the year 2024, when I was first entrusted with the responsibility of serving as Head Prefect. It was a role that came with great privilege, but also with significant and different challenges. Not every attempt was successful, and not every idea was met with enthusiasm and agreement. There were moments of doubt, times when the effort I invested seemed to go unnoticed, and instances when I questioned whether I was truly making a difference.<br>
Yet, it was through these challenges that I learned that setbacks do not define us. It is about finding the courage to push forward, even when the path ahead is uncertain. I also realise how important it is to have a support circle that understands and provides comfort in times of difficulty. This is a reminder to myself and my fellow schoolmates; to not be disheartened by failure, as it is a part of the journey toward success.</td>

    <td>KUAN JING LING <br>(2023-2024)</td>
    <td>Serving Lianhua as Head Prefect has been my greatest honour. Throughout the years I have spent in Lianhua, I have met many amazing people who contributed to the foundation of my character. I remember a key lesson on the power of resilience. Life is full of challenges, unexpected changes, failure and setbacks. Back in 2023, when I was a newly nominated Head Prefect, there were many new responsibilities I had to take such as initiating projects. Not every project was successful or even deemed a good idea. I did not know exactly where the path would lead. There were moments of uncertainty, of hard work that felt unrecognized, and times when I wondered if I was doing enough. But through the diverse experiences throughout the years serving the school, I learnt to bounce back from failure and learnt that setbacks don’t define us. What matters most is how we choose to respond, grow, and evolve from those experiences. I’ve come to understand is that success is not always about getting everything right on the first try. It’s about perseverance—about continuing to show up, even when things aren’t perfect. It's about learning from mistakes, seeking feedback, and pushing forward, even when the going gets tough. </td>

    <td>MARISSA BINTE MUNIR<br>(2022-2023)</td>
    <td>As the Head Prefect in Lianhua Primary School from 2022 to 2023, I had the privilege of leading by example and fostering a positive environment for my fellow students. I organized various school events, promoted discipline, and supported my peers in their academic and personal endeavors. It was a rewarding experience that taught me valuable leadership skills and the importance of teamwork. Now, in my secondary school, I look back on those days with fondness, cherishing the memories and lessons that have shaped me into the student I am today. Not long after my graduation, I was invited to speak to my juniors in Lianhua. I am very glad to be able to further contribute to Lianhua as an alumni, to connect with them and share my experience as a secondary school student. I am inspired to continue my leadership journey and to be a role model to my juniors.</td>

    <td>Being the head prefect from 2021 to 2022 has been incredibly rewarding. It was filled with meaningful experiences and opportunities for growth. As Head Prefect, l had the chance to lead and contribute to our school community in various ways. One of my most memorable experiences was planning for Teachers’ Day. Organizing that event allowed me to work closely with the core team to show our appreciation to our teachers who have guided and supported us. It was a joy to see our plans come to life and to witness the teachers' smiles and enjoyment during the day. Additionally, I had the privilege of leading Project Smile, a heartwarming initiative where the school arranged for essential groceries and necessities to the elderly and families in need. Coordinating this project was both challenging and deeply fulfilling. Seeing the positive impact we could make in our community was incredibly inspiring. These experiences have taught me valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and compassion. I am grateful for all the opportunities LHPS has provided me to grow into who I am now.</td>

    <td>TAN EMMA XIN PING<br>(2020/2021)</td>
    <td>Hello! I am Emma, the ex head prefect from 2020 in Lianhua Primary School. During these past six years in Lianhua l  have learned so much from the teachers and have gained a lot of amazing experiences. The teachers in Lianhua Primary have given me so many opportunities to flourish and to sharpen my leadership skills. I am very thankful for the teachers who have been guiding me and helping me to grow over the last 6 years. One of the memorable experiences that I will never forget is working together with the core team, teachers and the staff in the school to participate in the Smile project. To bring smiles to the students in need in school. I remember the teachers used to tell us during the prefect meeting “ A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions and the compassion to listen to others. He does not set out to be a leader, but becomes one by the quality of his actions and the integrity of his intent’.I would always hold that in my mind and continue to  do good for the school and to encourage others in the school to do the same. Even though I faced some challenges along the way, I knew that with the teachers’ help and the core team’s support, I could overcome any obstacles that came my way. Working with the core team also reminded me what true unity really was. Lianhua primary school really has brought me a lot of memories that I can reminisce about and inspire othersI will continue to stand tall and reach greater heights!</td>

    <td>JUSTIN HO GUAN XIAN<br>(2019/2020)</td>
    <td>Hi! I am Justin, past head prefect of Lianhua Primary School for the 2019 and 2020 batch. I am glad to have served the school to the utmost of my abilities when I was the head prefect. I remember that in 2020, during the first half of year, the core team decided together that we would do a project, called Care Packs, where we collected non-perishable food items that teachers and staff donated, and put them into packs for the needy people living in the neighbourhood across our school, as more people needed help during the COVID pandemic. It was an enriching experience that I will never forget.<br><br>During my 6 years of studying in Lianhua Primary School, I have made many good friends and awesome memories. I have learnt so much from teachers, staff and schoolmates. Overall, it was really enjoyable and the teachers made learning as engaging as possible.</td>

    <td>ANKIT RATHI<br>(2018/2019)</td>
    <td>Being in LHPS for 6 years, I’ve had so many amazing experiences and have grown so much. Starting all the way back in Primary 1, I used to hate coming to school, but my teachers and friends motivated me and helped me by making my school experience much more enjoyable in the early years. After I became a prefect in Primary 3, I immediately felt a sense of responsibility and took on my role with pride. As a prefect, I became more confident, but most importantly,  I learnt the importance of being proactive as a servant leader. From that year, I started to volunteer for initiatives such as the Running Hour, P-Love and Solar Buddy. From participating in these, I realised how fruitful and satisfying it is to be able to help others, which led me to start my first initiative in Primary 4 with some fellow prefects, the Freecycle Project. We collected used school items at the end of the year, carried out a process of sorting and recycling and then put them up for all students to take, and also to donate to the Salvation Army. This experience of carrying out my own initiative then led up to becoming part of the core team, and then, Head Prefect. This was by far the biggest achievement of mine in LHPS, providing me the opportunity to serve others in the school and the community through projects like the interactions on CNY with the elderly at Renci, and at the same time, grow as a person and as a leader. Now as a prefect in my secondary school, I hope to display and develop the values and virtues I have learnt from LHPS, from my inspiring teachers and fellow peers. </td>

    <td>VO TRI TAI<br>(2017/2018)</td>
    <td>I had an amazing experience in LHPS. From caring friends to friendly Teachers, they all have contributed to the amazing experience that I have. They have made adapting to a new environment much easier for me. Throughout my 3 years, LHPS had provided me with plentiful opportunities to serve the school. Such opportunities include Teachers’ Day planning and volunteering activities such as festive giving and CNY celebration with Renci. All of these would not be possible without the help of my fellow peers and core team members. One memorable incident that happened was when I quarrelled with my fellow core team member Kerlin over a problem that a primary one was facing because of our different views. The quarrel got serious to the point we both ended up crying. From that experience I learnt to remain calm and consider others’ point of view. We eventually talked it out and knew what went wrong. Our friendship deepened after that incident.</td>
