    <td>ANDREA CHANDRA PUTRI<br>(2015/2016)</td>
    <td>Being in Lianhua was very enriching and I have learnt so much from my 6 years here. I've had the honour of serving the school many times, be it representing the school in various events or being the head prefect. These experiences have made me who I am today and I am very thankful for them. One experience I particularly remember was the first time I was asked to help with flag-raising just minutes before assembly started and I was so unprepared that I didn't manage to keep my sling pouch and ended up carrying it while flag-raising

    <td>As the Head Prefect of 2017, it gave me a lot of opportunities to learn and grow as a leader.To me the whole journey as a Head prefect was memorable.Many events have helped nurture me in becoming a better leader.Like Teacher’s day,we were told to be the emcees for the event but on the day of rehearsal, we prepared nothing and sitting around waiting for instructions.We were reprimanded but the teachers taught me one of the most important value as a leader,which is to be proactive.To take the initiative to do something and not just sit around doing nothing.<br><br>Although there were many ups and downs during the process,it was all worthwhile.The guidance and support they have given me was really priceless and most importantly,it made me realise what it really means to be a leader.It is not a tittle and fame, it is sense of responsibility of having the role.</td>

    <td>I had an amazing experience in LHPS. From caring friends to friendly Teachers, they all have contributed to the amazing experience that I have. They have made adapting to a new environment much easier for me. Throughout my 3 years, LHPS had provided me with plentiful opportunities to serve the school. Such opportunities include Teachers’ Day planning and volunteering activities such as festive giving and CNY celebration with Renci. All of these would not be possible without the help of my fellow peers and core team members. One memorable incident that happened was when I quarrelled with my fellow core team member Kerlin over a problem that a primary one was facing because of our different views. The quarrel got serious to the point we both ended up crying. From that experience I learnt to remain calm and consider others’ point of view. We eventually talked it out and knew what went wrong. Our friendship deepened after that incident. </td>

    <td>Being in LHPS for 6 years, I’ve had so many amazing experiences and have grown so much. Starting all the way back in Primary 1, I used to hate coming to school, but my teachers and friends motivated me and helped me by making my school experience much more enjoyable in the early years. After I became a prefect in Primary 3, I immediately felt a sense of responsibility and took on my role with pride. As a prefect, I became more confident, but most importantly,  I learnt the importance of being proactive as a servant leader. From that year, I started to volunteer for initiatives such as the Running Hour, P-Love and Solar Buddy. From participating in these, I realised how fruitful and satisfying it is to be able to help others, which led me to start my first initiative in Primary 4 with some fellow prefects, the Freecycle Project. We collected used school items at the end of the year, carried out a process of sorting and recycling and then put them up for all students to take, and also to donate to the Salvation Army. This experience of carrying out my own initiative then led up to becoming part of the core team, and then, Head Prefect. This was by far the biggest achievement of mine in LHPS, providing me the opportunity to serve others in the school and the community through projects like the interactions on CNY with the elderly at Renci, and at the same time, grow as a person and as a leader. Now as a prefect in my secondary school, I hope to display and develop the values and virtues I have learnt from LHPS, from my inspiring teachers and fellow peers. </td>

    <td>Hi! I am Justin, past head prefect of Lianhua Primary School for the 2019 and 2020 batch. I am glad to have served the school to the utmost of my abilities when I was the head prefect. I remember that in 2020, during the first half of year, the core team decided together that we would do a project, called Care Packs, where we collected non-perishable food items that teachers and staff donated, and put them into packs for the needy people living in the neighbourhood across our school, as more people needed help during the COVID pandemic. It was an enriching experience that I will never forget.<br><br>During my 6 years of studying in Lianhua Primary School, I have made many good friends and awesome memories. I have learnt so much from teachers, staff and schoolmates. Overall, it was really enjoyable and the teachers made learning as engaging as possible.</td>
