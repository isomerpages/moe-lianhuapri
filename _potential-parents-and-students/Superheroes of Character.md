# Superheroes of Character


<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Superheroes of Character are students who have exemplified the values of our school through their daily lives. These students have been nominated by their teachers and endorsed by an interviewing panel. As Ghandhi once said,</p>

<center><i><b>"Your beliefs become your thoughts,<br>Your thoughts become your words,<br>Your words become your actions,<br>Your actions become your habits,<br>Your habits become your values,<br>Your values become your destiny."</b></i></center>

At Lianhua, we believe that a person’s values will ultimately pave his/her path to success.  Here are some of their stories.

## Nurbalqis Fikrisya Binte Mohar

    <td> <p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine a child who is so well-behaved that year after year, she gets nominated and selected for the STAR awards, which is the school’s award for those who have exhibited good values throughout the year. One of these students is Fikrisya. From a tender age, Fikrisya has always been polite and industrious.  She takes great pride in her work and improves herself constantly.  She is unfazed by difficulties and works hard to attain her personal goals. In P5, she was selected to go for the OCE to JogJakarta. While she was there, in addition to being a great role model to her peers, conducting herself with poise and being self-disciplined, she also looked out for her peers. If a member of her party was not feeling well, Fikrisya would let her teachers know at the earliest opportunity and helped to take care of her friends. Despite some parts of the journey being a little arduous, Fikrisya did not complain at all. Instead, she would encourage her friends to forge on, displaying great fortitude. Being a Vice Chairperson of the Prefectorial Board, Firkisya also managed her time well as she balanced her academics and school leadership roles. She is truly an excellent role model!</p></td>

    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">The start of the Covid-19 pandemic was especially difficult for Estella. She had to find new ways to adapt and learn from online lessons, both for her studies and her passion in dance. Despite the difficulties of online learning, Estella managed her time well and showed willingness to learn. When faced with technical difficulties during home-based learning, she demonstrated resilience and tenacity. Estella continued to be positive towards studying and never gave up. She also displayed great adaptability, as she transited from home-based lessons to face-to-face lessons quickly and continued to work hard. Estella also readily accepted the challenge to lead her group of friends in a graduation performance. Leading friends in a performance is not an easy task, but Estella persisted and learnt to lead them well. Eventually, Estella and her group of friends managed to put up a remarkable performance for graduation, marking the end of their six-year journey together.</p></td>

    <td> <p style="text-align: justify;">English is the language that all subjects except Mother Tongue are taught with. Hence, it is important to have a strong foundation in it. What happens when you are unable to read well? Faith once faced this problem. Through the Buddy Reading Programme, she was able to overcome her difficulties in reading and in turn paid it forward by becoming a Buddy Reader herself. Faith says that having struggled to read well, she could understand how her buddy felt and remember how challenging some words were to read. She made went the extra mile to ensure that her pronunciation for those words were accurate before guiding her buddy. It is also because she had once wrestled with reading that Faith is especially patient with her buddy, repeating the words with her buddy tirelessly until he was able to pronounce the word accurately. Well done, Faith!</p></td>
