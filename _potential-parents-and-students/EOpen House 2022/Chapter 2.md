<center><i>"Be passionately curious and try new things"  - Inquisitive Ismail</i></center>


Here in Lianhua, we want our students to be curious about the world and things around them. Students acquire new knowledge through critical thinking, problem solving and collaboration in various fun learning environments. Our curriculum and programmes focus on the 4A dimensions (Authencity, Ambiguity, Autonomy and Actualisation) to enhance student experience and to deepen their learning.

  

Passion Project

Here in Lianhua, students are guided in their learning but are given the autonomy to make good decisions and choices to directly impact their learning. The feeling of actualisation is manifested in the showcase of their passion

  

Every Lianhuarean, A Superhero. Every superhero is an inspiration to others. Helping our students find their purpose in life and providing them a platform to pursue their passion enables them to positively influence their peers. A sense of purpose nurtures an inquisitive nature in our students as they yearn to find out more about their passion. In line with our school’s motto, “Play, Passion, Purpose”, students share what they are passionate about with their teachers and peers.
