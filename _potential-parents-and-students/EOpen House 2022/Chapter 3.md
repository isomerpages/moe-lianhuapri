Superheroes do not always wear capes. Among us are many Lianhuareans who have served others and the community with humility and purpose to make a difference in lives. They dedicated time and energy selflessly to help those in need. By nurturing our students to be caring and compassionate towards others, our students learn that regardless of their circumstances, they can do their part to make a difference to the people around them.

**Everyday Superheroes**
