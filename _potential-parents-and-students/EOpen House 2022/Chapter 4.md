<center><i>"To lead others well, you have to first lead yourself well."  - Confident Colin</i></center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this changing world, we want our students to mature into fine citizens who are confident and have a strong belief in their self-worth. Here at Lianhua, students are provided with multiple opportunities to engage others with confidence as they develop awareness of their own strengths and aspirations both in and out of the classroom.</p>

**Project SMILE**

<p style="text-align: justify;">SMILE, an acronym that stands for Sharing Miracles in Life Every Day, is a project where Lianhua Primary School partners many agencies to bring smiles and be a blessing to others. With guidance and support from the teachers, Lianhua's Prefects Core Team leads the planning and execution of the programme annually. Find out more about their thoughts as they share their experiences in this video below:</p>
