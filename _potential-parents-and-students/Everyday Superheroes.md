# Everyday Superheroes

At Lianhua Primary, voluntarism is a way of life. Students have ample opportunities to be a blessing to our community. Here are some examples!

## Project Smile

It encapsulates our school’s motto ‘Play, Passion, Purpose’, as well as our school’s mission. Despite the fact that many long running VIA projects had been shelved due to restrictions in interactions between students and external agencies, the school continued with Project Smile for most of the year, except during periods of stricter Covid guidelines. Project Smile is especially meaningful in this time of need for the nation and in spite of their busy schedules, our Core Team led their fellow pupils to pack and distribute these relief packs to needy residents in the community.</p> **Ms Kiew and our Core Team**|


## Our Neighbourhood Superhero—Shakthi

|   <p style="text-align: justify;">Project Smile was so successful that it inspired our then P1 student, Shakthi from Primary 1 Resilience to start a ‘Care and Share’ corner. Using $400 from her savings, Shakthi, together with her mother, Mdm Jmaleni Saravanan, bought essential items such as instant noodles, canned food, biscuits, packet drinks and cooking oil and set up a corner with the donated items at her block from June 1 to June 30 2021. Her parents and Project Smile stepped in to contribute even more items to the corner. This act of service by a young P1 student further inspired other residents in the neighbourhood to make their own contributions to the corner. Hence, the corner was kept well-stocked during the period of time.</p>     | ![](/images/Potential%20Parents%20&%20Students/Everyday%20Superheroes/Everydayhero2.png)  |


<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Well done, Shakthi, we hope that as you grow up, you will continue to keep this passion alive!</b><br><a href="https://mothership.sg/2021/06/free-grocery-corner-bukit-batok/" target="_blank">https://mothership.sg/2021/06/free-grocery-corner-bukit-batok/</a></p>
