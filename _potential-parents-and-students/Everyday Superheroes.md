# Everyday Superheroes

At Lianhua Primary, voluntarism is a way of life. Students have ample opportunities to be a blessing to our community. Here are some examples!

## Project Smile

The act of voluntarism can be said to be the fruit of CCE at Lianhua. It encapsulates our school’s motto ‘Play, Passion, Purpose’, as well as our school’s mission. Despite the fact that many long running VIA projects had been shelved due to restrictions in interactions between students and external agencies, the school continued with Project Smile for most of the year, except during periods of stricter Covid guidelines. Project Smile is especially meaningful in this time of need for the nation and in spite of their busy schedules, our Core Team led their fellow pupils to pack and distribute these relief packs to needy residents in the community.
