# Superheroes of Learning


Superheroes of Learning are students of our school who might have faced difficulties in learning, be it due to the environment around them or personally. They have all exhibited much tenacity and grit and have overcome the challenges that they face. Here are some of their stories.

## Bashira Jahan

Living in a neighbourhood far from school meant long travelling times. As a result, Bashira was short on time to revise and rest. Nevertheless, her determination to do well in the PSLE and not disappoint her parents spurred her on. During home-based learning where some others might be less motivated, Bashira stayed organised and self-disciplined. She continued to do her work conscientiously. In addition, Bashira devised effective strategies to revise her work and frequently shared her notes with others. Her optimistic attitude, despite the prevailing pandemic, rubbed off on others and her peers felt at ease around her, and were spurred on to study hard. Bashira’s artistic flair had also earned her compliments from others. When faced with multiple requests from teachers, she did not hesitate to accept these challenges and delivered art pieces that exceeded expectations.
