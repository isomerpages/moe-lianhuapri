    <td> <p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine a child who is so well-behaved that year after year, she gets nominated and selected for the STAR awards, which is the school’s award for those who have exhibited good values throughout the year. One of these students is Fikrisya. From a tender age, Fikrisya has always been polite and industrious. &nbsp;She takes great pride in her work and improves herself constantly. &nbsp;She is unfazed by difficulties and works hard to attain her personal goals. In P5, she was selected to go for the OCE to JogJakarta. While she was there, in addition to being a great role model to her peers, conducting herself with poise and being self-disciplined, she also looked out for her peers. If a member of her party was not feeling well, Fikrisya would let her teachers know at the earliest opportunity and helped to take care of her friends. Despite some parts of the journey being a little arduous, Fikrisya did not complain at all. Instead, she would encourage her friends to forge on, displaying great fortitude. Being a Vice Chairperson of the Prefectorial Board, Firkisya also managed her time well as she balanced her academics and school leadership roles. She is truly an excellent role model!</p></td>

    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">Not all superheroes make a splash when they enter. Some of them work tirelessly in the background. However, all superheroes have this in common. They have made an impact in someone’s life and imprinted their image in the memories of those who were fortunate enough to have come across them. One such superhero is Luqman. Luqman is a quiet and industrious student with a growth mindset. He doesn’t let the obstacles he faces deter him from working towards his goals. In a year where Covid-19 has thrown a spanner in the preparation for PSLE, Luqman continues to take his work seriously and completes his work well. However, Luqman isn’t just a person who works for himself. He displays a maturity beyond his years and takes the time, despite his heavy commitments in CCA and his academics, to lend a listening ear to his friends. Is it any wonder that he is well-liked by his peers? His sheer hard work and determination have earned him the Young Scholar Award, SAIL Award, STAR Award and a nomination for the Student of the Year Award 2020. </p></td>

    <td> <p style="text-align: justify;">Like Fikrisya, Qidran has always been nominated for the STAR award. Despite facing personal difficulties as a child, he was able to overcome them and be a role model for his peers. Qidran managed to strike a good balance between being respectful and being able to liven up the atmosphere in class. This helped the other students in class learn self-discipline and self-management. Qidran also cared deeply for the people around him, especially his classmates. One of his new classmates had difficulty adjusting to the school environment, so Qidran reached out to him and befriended him. This gave his classmate the confidence to be the best that he could be and to assimilate into the Lianhua culture. In spite of his hectic schedule revolving around the CORE team, his CCAs and his academics, Qidran always found time to lend a helping hand to those in need—even to those in the neighbourhood. During the weeks leading up to the National Day celebrations, even though he was hard at work preparing for his preliminary examinations, when Qidran spotted a member of the RC struggling to put up banners and flags for the celebrations, Qidran led his friends to help out. Qidran has truly personified our school values! As a result, in 2021, Qidran became the Student of the Year.</p></td>
