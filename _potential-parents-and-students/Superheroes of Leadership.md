# Superheroes of Leadership

<p style="text-align: justify;">When we think of a leader, many times the people who come to mind are Ghandhi, Abraham Lincoln or even Singapore’s very own Founding Father, Mr Lee Kwan Yew. These are great men of their times, each exhibiting courage, wisdom and many praiseworthy qualities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At Lianhua, while our students aspire to greatness, our brand of leadership is unique in a world that focuses on the glamorous. Instead, very simply, we practise Servant Leadership. Servant Leadership encapsulates the mission of LPS and our vision for our students. Instead of leading by merely directing, our leaders at LPS roll up their sleeves and serve the people around them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, our superheroes of Leadership are people who have exhibited qualities of leadership in their daily acts of service to their friends, the school and the community and perhaps inspired others with their passion. Here are some of their stories.</p>

    <td> <p style="text-align: justify;">Bogwang is the captain of our school’s Senior Boys Volleyball team, which isn’t easy when you consider the fact that he is easily one of the shortest boys in the team. Despite his stature, Bogwang more than makes up for it through his indomitable spirit and quest for excellence. When he first started his journey with volleyball, he wasn’t good at it and often needed others’ help. However, he improved slowly but surely, and in the process, learnt resilience and honed his skills at volleyball. Perhaps what truly sets Bogwang apart is his attitude towards winning and losing, which has been transmitted to his teammates through his leadership by example. In his own words, “When my team competed in the soft volleyball tournament against 10 schools in 2019, our team came in first place! I was also proud of our achievement. However, I also realised that volleyball was not all about winning. We also learnt to display good sportsmanship when we lost a match and to cooperate well with my team members. Through all these, our team grew stronger mentally and physically.” However, Bogwang’s care for his teammates goes beyond just volleyball. Some of his friends were lagging behind in Mathematics, and Bogwang, who is passionate about Mathematics, lent a helping hand and encouraged them to do well in their studies. Bogwang was truly a servant leader!</p></td>

    <td><p style="text-align: justify;">Not all superheroes make a splash when they enter. Some of them work tirelessly in the background. However, all superheroes have this in common. They have made an impact in someone’s life and imprinted their image in the memories of those who were fortunate enough to have come across them. One such superhero is Luqman. Luqman is a quiet and industrious student with a growth mindset. He doesn’t let the obstacles he faces deter him from working towards his goals. In a year where Covid-19 has thrown a spanner in the preparation for PSLE, Luqman continues to take his work seriously and completes his work well. However, Luqman isn’t just a person who works for himself. He displays a maturity beyond his years and takes the time, despite his heavy commitments in CCA and his academics, to lend a listening ear to his friends. Is it any wonder that he is well-liked by his peers? His sheer hard work and determination have earned him the Young Scholar Award, SAIL Award, STAR Award and a nomination for the Student of the Year Award 2020. </p></td>
