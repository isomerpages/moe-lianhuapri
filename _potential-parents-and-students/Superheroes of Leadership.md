# Superheroes of Leadership

<p style="text-align: justify;">When we think of a leader, many times the people who come to mind are Ghandhi, Abraham Lincoln or even Singapore’s very own Founding Father, Mr Lee Kwan Yew. These are great men of their times, each exhibiting courage, wisdom and many praiseworthy qualities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At Lianhua, while our students aspire to greatness, our brand of leadership is unique in a world that focuses on the glamorous. Instead, very simply, we practise Servant Leadership. Servant Leadership encapsulates the mission of LPS and our vision for our students. Instead of leading by merely directing, our leaders at LPS roll up their sleeves and serve the people around them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, our superheroes of Leadership are people who have exhibited qualities of leadership in their daily acts of service to their friends, the school and the community and perhaps inspired others with their passion. Here are some of their stories.</p>

    <td> <p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine a child who is so well-behaved that year after year, she gets nominated and selected for the STAR awards, which is the school’s award for those who have exhibited good values throughout the year. One of these students is Fikrisya. From a tender age, Fikrisya has always been polite and industrious.  She takes great pride in her work and improves herself constantly.  She is unfazed by difficulties and works hard to attain her personal goals. In P5, she was selected to go for the OCE to JogJakarta. While she was there, in addition to being a great role model to her peers, conducting herself with poise and being self-disciplined, she also looked out for her peers. If a member of her party was not feeling well, Fikrisya would let her teachers know at the earliest opportunity and helped to take care of her friends. Despite some parts of the journey being a little arduous, Fikrisya did not complain at all. Instead, she would encourage her friends to forge on, displaying great fortitude. Being a Vice Chairperson of the Prefectorial Board, Firkisya also managed her time well as she balanced her academics and school leadership roles. She is truly an excellent role model!</p></td>

They have made an impact in someone’s life and imprinted their image in the memories of those who were fortunate enough to have come across them. One such superhero is Luqman. Luqman is a quiet and industrious student with a growth mindset. He doesn’t let the obstacles he faces deter him from working towards his goals. In a year where Covid-19 has thrown a spanner in the preparation for PSLE, Luqman continues to take his work seriously and completes his work well. However, Luqman isn’t just a person who works for himself. He displays a maturity beyond his years and takes the time, despite his heavy commitments in CCA and his academics, to lend a listening ear to his friends. Is it any wonder that he is well-liked by his peers? His sheer hard work and determination have earned him the Young Scholar Award, SAIL Award, STAR Award and a nomination for the Student of the Year Award 2020. </p></td>
