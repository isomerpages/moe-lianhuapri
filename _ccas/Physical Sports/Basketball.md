#### **Purposes of CCA**

At Lianhua Primary School, Basketball CCA is more than just a platform for students in their pursuit of their interest and for learning values. We want our members to experience the joy of learning at training sessions, cultivate minds of inquiry in becoming a thinking player, so as to build their confidence in life when they experience successes. We aim to make every member a good player with great skills and a fantastic attitude. Not only would this enable them to be eager to learn for life but to also give back to society by helping out in the school and community.

  
**Competition**

Selected players will represent Lianhua to participate in the Annual National Sports Games. Players learn how to win sportingly and lose with dignity. In the meantime, they also learn to exhibit Olympian Values such as respect, excellence and friendship in the competition.

Back in July last year, the selection for the senior basketball school team began.

After vigorous training exercises from July till December, I was eventually chosen for the school team. I was elated at that time. After that, we attended the National School Games. I was very nervous when we had our first match against Westwood Primary School. After that, I stopped being nervous. There was one time where we were matched up against Qifa Primary School in the final. At the end of the first half, we were down 11-22, but we did not give up and continued to play at our usual standards. At the last minute of the game, we were tied with Qifa 31-31. However, Qifa scored and when we counter-attacked, we only managed to score one more point.

Although we were out of the games, I learnt to be more resilient and never give up no matter how bad the score was. I also learnt to work together with my teammates as basketball is a team sport. I hope to continue playing basketball in secondary school.

Teamwork is the most important spirit in every sport. The most unforgettable time was the match between&nbsp; Peichun Primary School and&nbsp; Lianhua Primary School. Although we lost the game, I felt that most of us had put in our best effort. We have &nbsp;good team spirit within the team as we had been training tirelessly every training session and even after school! Mr Wong would also book a place for us to train together. I have learnt to be a better team player and I would love to continue playing basketball after six&nbsp; years in Lianhua. My basketball journey has not ended yet. There is still more to come in the&nbsp; upcoming years.&nbsp;

In competitions, we went against many formidable opponents. Everytime we have a match, we would learn something out of it that would help us in our following matches. We had&nbsp; never lost any matches until the finals against Qifa. The first and second quarter were tough on us as their score was double of ours. The third and fourth quarter looked better for us. On multiple occasions, we were tie in scores, but Qifa managed to score a ball against us in the last few seconds of the game. We were scrambling to get two &nbsp;more points, but in the end we only managed to draw a foul and scored one point. It was a painful experience to lose but that was not going to stop us from advancing into Nationals.&nbsp;

In the Nationals, we won our first match. We got complacent and that caused our downfall in the second match. Since then, we have learnt not to underestimate our opponent and play to our best ability.&nbsp; In our final match, everyone was very focused and determined to win. Tying the score multiple times but unfortunately, we were not strong enough to beat them. With that, we were officially out of the nationals. In the end, we were top two in the West and top 16 in the nationals. This was truly a once in a lifetime experience. A golden opportunity.

I started playing basketball when I first joined Lianhua Primary School in Primary 4. At first, I thought that basketball was all about dribbling and throwing&nbsp; the ball into the hoop. That changed completely after all the vigorous training. I realised that every game encompasses a&nbsp; purpose. Since then, I started to play basketball for at least two hours a day and gradually, basketball became my passion. I remember that I was over the moon whenever I had the chance to play in a basketball game. When I got to represent the school in basketball for the first time, I was still quite daunted. However, opportunity waits for no man. I grabbed it and I have learnt a lot from it. Now, I am way more confident in everything I do during a competition and I want to thank the coaches for giving me the opportunity to improve. During the competition period, I managed to get to know my teammates better as we had spent a lot of time playing basketball together and enjoyed doing so a lot . I take this as a once in a lifetime opportunity and I treasured it.
