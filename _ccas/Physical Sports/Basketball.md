#### Purposes of CCA

At Lianhua Primary School, Basketball CCA is more than just a platform for students in their pursuit of their interest and for learning values. We want our members to experience the joy of learning at training sessions, cultivate minds of inquiry in becoming a thinking player, so as to build their confidence in life when they experience successes. We aim to make every member a good player with great skills and a fantastic attitude. Not only would this enable them to be eager to learn for life but to also give back to society by helping out in the school and community.

Selected players will represent Lianhua to participate in the Annual National Sports Games. Players learn how to win sportingly and lose with dignity. In the meantime, they also learn to exhibit Olympian Values such as respect, excellence and friendship in the competition.

Friendly matches with schools are always organized on an annual basis to provide an avenue for members to build confidence and foster strong bonds with each other. It also serves as a platform for coaches and teachers to select the school team members.
