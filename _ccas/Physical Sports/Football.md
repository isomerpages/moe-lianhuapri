# **Football**

Football is a fantastic way to stay fit and active, as it involves a lot of running and footwork. Beyond its physical benefits, football also promotes important values such as teamwork and discipline, fostering good sportsmanship. This year, our school's football team has demonstrated these values through their exemplary actions and attitudes.

Every year, our football teams (Senior &amp; Junior Division) participate in the highly competitive National School Games (NSG). At the start of 2023, our senior boys faced off against numerous schools, displaying great teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship in every match. They demonstrated their loyalty and dedication to our school by singing the school song before and after each game. Their remarkable sportsmanship after each game, cheering and wishing their opponents well, was truly exceptional and deserving of praise. Through hard work and dedication, our boys secured 4th place at the NSG West Zone Senior Division Football competition.

Up next, are our Junior Division boys, who will be competing in the NSG Junior Division Football competition. We wish them the best of luck and hope they will follow in the footsteps of their senior counterparts by demonstrating strong teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship. Well done, Lianhua football teams!

## **Students' Voices**


I have always been fascinated by my brother, Hakeem. He is a good player and is able to control the ball well. I realised that Hakeem was good because of the long hours of training and playing soccer. Thus I am inspired to become like him. I am lucky as my brother Hakeem always trains me in the afternoons.

Training with my friends in school further enhances my skills and knowledge about soccer. Our Soccer CCA teachers train us to become good players. I love to learn from them. Not only on technique, we are also reminded of teamwork, the motivation to fight as a team and also to lose as a team.  

One player I love to play with is Danish Alfian. He plays as the striker in our team. Danish is a skillful player. Playing along with him gives me the confidence of winning. Football has given me so much and I will continue to strive to be a better player.

I always strive to be the best in the team. So to achieve that, I have to train hard and work hard during training. I really love the training conducted by our Soccer teachers. It consists of so many activities from ball skills and playing as a team.

I remembered playing in the tournament. I can see that the team puts so much trust in me to score goals. I was a little nervous at first but after a few games, I began to be more confident and make fewer mistakes.

I still remember when I made a last pass to Gahan during a game and he managed to score a goal for the team. Although we lost the game, the teamwork, motivation to fight as a team and play for our school is very satisfying.
