# Football

Football is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries which makes it the most popular sport in the world. In some countries football is also known as “soccer” where a team of eleven players sweat it out in the field against the opponent, passing the ball around and aiming to get the ball into the opponent’s goal. It is a great form of exercise as there is lots of running and footwork involved. Apart from its health benefits, football also emphasises on the values of teamwork and discipline, as it promotes good sportsmanship.

This popular game has enticed many students in Lianhua Primary School to join the Football CCA which has been around for many years. Every year, we participated in the highly sought after Inter School Tournament which consists of more than 40 schools in the West Zone. At the beginning of the year 2021, we had a few fruitful face-to-face sessions and were preparing our boys for the tournament. However, due to COVID-19 regulations, the tournament was cancelled. Nevertheless, we persevered and continued our CCA through zoom sessions.
