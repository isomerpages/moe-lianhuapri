Lianhua Football Teams, Our Pride and Joy!

Football is more than just a sportâ€”it is a platform for students to build fitness, teamwork, and discipline. At Lianhua, our football teams embody these values both on and off the field, demonstrating outstanding sportsmanship and dedication.

This year, our Senior Division boys participated in the highly competitive National School Games (NSG), showcasing their resilience and teamwork against other schools. Their unwavering commitment was evident in every match, from their disciplined gameplay to their heartfelt congratulations and wishes for their opponents after each game. Beyond their performance, they upheld the spirit of sportsmanship by never giving up and fighting till the very end for their school.

As we thank our senior boys for their unwavering effort, we now turn our support to our Junior Division team, who will soon take the field in the NSG Junior Division Football competition. We wish them the best of luck and are confident they will continue the legacy of teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship set by their seniors.

Well done, Lianhua football teams! Keep striving for excellence!

#### Students' Voices

Here is an update on our National School Games journey. My team has made our school proud by clinching the top four positions at the West Zone Inter-School Football Tournament this year!

Even though we lost a game with Bukit View Primary School during the second round, we did not let it affect us. We worked hard and motivated each other. This resulted in us getting closer as a team. As we played the game against St Anthony, we kept our focus and showed grit! We won and we got through the semifinals! However, during the semi-final game against Dazhong Primary School, we lost 2-1.&nbsp;

We will continue to work hard and make our school proud!

Next week, my team will be continuing the tournament and will be fighting for 3rd/4th placing in the Nationals!&nbsp;

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms Kiew, Mdm Tan, Mrs Low, teachers, our parents and all our schoolmates for their support.

I have always been fascinated by my brother, Hakeem. He is a good player and is able to control the ball well. I realised that Hakeem was good because of the long hours of training and playing soccer. Thus I am inspired to become like him. I am lucky as my brother Hakeem always trains me in the afternoons.

Training with my friends in school further enhances my skills and knowledge about soccer. Our Soccer CCA teachers train us to become good players. I love to learn from them. Not only on technique, we are also reminded of teamwork, the motivation to fight as a team and also to lose as a team.  

One player I love to play with is Danish Alfian. He plays as the striker in our team. Danish is a skillful player. Playing along with him gives me the confidence of winning. Football has given me so much and I will continue to strive to be a better player.

I always strive to be the best in the team. So to achieve that, I have to train hard and work hard during training. I really love the training conducted by our Soccer teachers. It consists of so many activities from ball skills and playing as a team.

I remembered playing in the tournament. I can see that the team puts so much trust in me to score goals. I was a little nervous at first but after a few games, I began to be more confident and make fewer mistakes.

I still remember when I made a last pass to Gahan during a game and he managed to score a goal for the team. Although we lost the game, the teamwork, motivation to fight as a team and play for our school is very satisfying.
