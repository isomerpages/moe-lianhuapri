# **Football**

Football is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries which makes it the most popular sport in the world. In some countries football is also known as “soccer” where a team of eleven players sweat it out in the field against the opponent, passing the ball around and aiming to get the ball into the opponent’s goal. It is a great form of exercise as there is lots of running and footwork involved. Apart from its health benefits, football also emphasises on the values of teamwork and discipline, as it promotes good sportsmanship.

This popular game has enticed many students in Lianhua Primary School to join the Football CCA which has been around for many years. Every year, we participated in the highly sought after Inter School Tournament which consists of more than 40 schools in the West Zone. At the beginning of the year 2021, we had a few fruitful face-to-face sessions and were preparing our boys for the tournament. However, due to COVID-19 regulations, the tournament was cancelled. Nevertheless, we persevered and continued our CCA through zoom sessions.

## **Experiences**

Our current coach, Coach Wandy, ensured that the zoom CCA sessions were meaningful and filled with lots of experiences for our players to remember. Apart from learning football skills, Coach Wandy even boosted the students’ fitness levels through carefully selected drills.

On top of that, Coach Wandy also managed to invite Singapore’s local football stars such as Bhaihaki Khaizan, Gabriel Quek, Shahril Ishak and the legend of Singapore football, Fandi Ahmad himself to our zoom CCA sessions!

The football stars shared their struggles and how they persevered during their football career. The insightful session had them sharing with us their words of wisdom that emphasises on personal values which reignited our students’ passion in football.

“There is nothing but only hard work. It’s hard work. Hard work and only hard work. There is no…I mean there is no short cut,” quipped Bhaihaki Khaizan and he further advised our students not to only train in the field with their coach but to carry out their own training whenever they can.

“Football is a team game. There are 11 individuals in there with only 1 goal in mind, to win the match,” Gabriel Quek said as he went on to mention that students must also focus when they are playing the game.

“You just need to go out there and do your best. It is all in the mind,” Sharil Ishak encouraged the students by informing them that hard work is the key to everything.

“The three D’s in football - discipline, determination and dedication. But the most important thing is sacrifice. If you do not sacrifice, you will never go anywhere. It is not always about the skill. It’s the will. You must sacrifice,” Fandi Ahmad passionately advised the students. He further said that as players, they need to stay focused and have a plan in mind. It is all about the passion for the game that should propel them to improve themselves and to enjoy the game when they play.

Our football players learnt valuable pointers from our local football stars. Their sharing will definitely motivate our footballers to grow in this sport. Who best to give them life lessons other than the personalities who are directly involved in this beautiful game!

## **Students' Voices**

I have always been fascinated by my brother, Hakeem. He is a good player and is able to control the ball well. I realised that Hakeem was good because of the long hours of training and playing soccer. Thus I am inspired to become like him. I am lucky as my brother Hakeem always trains me in the afternoons.

Training with my friends in school further enhances my skills and knowledge about soccer. Our Soccer CCA teachers train us to become good players. I love to learn from them. Not only on technique, we are also reminded of teamwork, the motivation to fight as a team and also to lose as a team.  

One player I love to play with is Danish Alfian. He plays as the striker in our team. Danish is a skillful player. Playing along with him gives me the confidence of winning. Football has given me so much and I will continue to strive to be a better player.

I always strive to be the best in the team. So to achieve that, I have to train hard and work hard during training. I really love the training conducted by our Soccer teachers. It consists of so many activities from ball skills and playing as a team.

I remembered playing in the tournament. I can see that the team puts so much trust in me to score goals. I was a little nervous at first but after a few games, I began to be more confident and make fewer mistakes.

I still remember when I made a last pass to Gahan during a game and he managed to score a goal for the team. Although we lost the game, the teamwork, motivation to fight as a team and play for our school is very satisfying.
