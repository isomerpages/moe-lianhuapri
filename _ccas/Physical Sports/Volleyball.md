## Purposes of CCA


In Lianhua Primary School, Volleyball CCA is more than just a platform for students to pursue their interest and for learning values. We want our members to experience the joy of learning during their training sessions, cultivate their minds of inquiry in becoming a thinking player, so as to build their confidence in life when they experience successes. We aim to grow every member into a good player with excellent skills and even better attitudes. In turn this will enable them to become lifelong learners and active contributors to society..
