#### Purposes of CCA

Lianhua Primary School’s Volleyball CCA offers more than just a means for students to pursue their interest in the sport. Our focus is on providing an enriching experience that promotes values such as inquiry, confidence, and lifelong learning. We aim to nurture each member’s skills and attitudes, with the goal of producing not just good players, but well-rounded individuals who are capable of making positive contributions to society.

#### Competition

Our program is designed to encourage a joy of learning, where students can discover and explore their potential as thinking players. We believe that success is not just about winning, but also about learning how to win and lose graciously. As such, selected players are given the opportunity to represent Lianhua Primary School in the annual National Sports Games, where they can put their skills and sportsmanship to the test while embodying values such as respect, excellence, and friendship.

#### Friendly matches

We also organize friendly matches with other schools on an annual basis. These matches provide an avenue for our members to build confidence, foster strong bonds with their teammates, and showcase their skills to coaches and teachers who may select them for the school team. Through these activities, we hope to instill a love for the sport, promote teamwork and sportsmanship, and prepare our members for success in all aspects of life.

#### Students' Voices

Hi everyone! I'm Sumiko from 6 Diligence, and I'm the captain of the senior girls volleyball team. When I first joined volleyball in P3, I wasn't very keen as my hands would hurt after a long training session. However, I tried my best and it turned out that I really enjoyed volleyball! Being in volleyball has taught me many skills, like teamwork and quick thinking. I remembered one of my proudest moments in volleyball. was when I was told that I was selected as the captain of the school team! I was so excited to be able to represent the school with my teammates in tournaments and matches. I hope you will choose volleyball cca as your first option. Join us for training next time. We look forward to seeing you!

Hi everyone, I am Bogwang from 6 Resilience and I am the captain of the school volleyball team. When I first joined Volleyball, I was not good at it and would often need others to help me, but slowly I improved and learnt to be resilient and work with others better. When my team competed in the soft volleyball tournament against 10 schools in 2019, our team came in first place! I was also proud of our achievement. However, I also realised that volleyball was not all about winning. We also learnt to display good sportsmanship when we lost a match and to cooperate well with my team members. Through all these, our team grew stronger mentally and physically. Our volleyball CCA has both boys and girls teams. I hope you will choose volleyball CCA as your first option and join us for training. We look forward to having you join us!
