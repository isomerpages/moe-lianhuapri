#### Purpose of CCA

Scouts CCA is the only uniformed group CCA in Lianhua Primary School. We are really proud of our cub scouts for donning their uniform smartly every Tuesday.

Through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, students will learn how to contribute to the education of young people in order to help create a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a positive role in society. They will work to obtain a number of Badges, which serve to certify their accomplishments in many facets of scouting and teach them fundamental Scouting skills. 

As they are prepared to become more aware of the needs of the community through leadership and social communication skills, students cultivate compassion and kindness. Scouting encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual and social development of youth with a strong emphasis on duty to God, duty to country, and helping other people.

The highest award is the Akela Award.

They are also given the opportunity to achieve their proficiency badges.
