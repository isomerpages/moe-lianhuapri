# Science Club
## Purposes of Cool Science Club

Cool Science Club is the place to be if you are passionate about Science. At our club, we want our members to be curious about their world. As good scientists, our members learn to make observations, ask questions and do research work in the process of searching for the answers to the many questions they encounter in our daily lives. By doing research and gathering evidence, they also learn how to communicate their findings through data and results. We hope to continue to cultivate our members’ abilities to make contributions and positively impact the community around them.

## Experiences


## Life Science

Members go beyond what they have learnt in the textbooks and classrooms. They get to explore and discover the nature around them. With the number of rich learning spaces in our school, our members had multiple opportunities to have close-up encounters with flora and fauna.


## Physical Science

Physical Science is not boring – not when we can conduct a range of experiments involving paper planes and optical illusions on campus. Our members were also tasked to complete STEM challenges using their creativity and knowledge of Science. There is truly no limit to the number of things that we can learn and make by just being curious about how things around us work!

#### Eco-stewardship

Life on Mother Earth can only be sustained if we use her resources wisely and in a sustainable manner. Through E-STEM projects, our students learned to use our natural environment wisely and to protect it. Our E-STEM programmes sought to integrate Design Thinking principles to solve real-life environmental problems that Lianhua pupils might be familiar with.

## Students' Voices

'Cool Science Club is a place where I can let my thoughts roam free. When we constructed our prototype to separate magnetic waste from non-magnetic waste, I enjoyed the Ideation process as I love inventing very much. The teachers in the CCA are also very supportive and will always give me feedback and advice.'&nbsp;

‘In newspapers, you see new prototypes and you always think that inventing them is a&nbsp; piece of cake. But it’s not. It requires critical thinking, resilience and almost all of our school values So if there is another project/ prototype, count me in. :),’

‘Cool Science Club is fun. When we are given a prototype to design, we first plan by writing and drawing what we need to do in our exercise book. Then we test and refine it. This builds our resilience as we try and try again to improve our prototype. I love Cool Science Club because I learn many new things every week.’

'I really enjoyed the Karakuri lessons even though I faced challenges during the construction process. My teachers and friends were there to help me so I managed to successfully complete my Karakuri project! The activities were engaging and I definitely had fun. I look forward to many more fun lessons with Cool Science Club!'&nbsp;

‘Science Club has always been fun to me because the teachers are nice to the club members. They always come up with ideas for new science experiments and teach us how to make Karakuri and leaf press projects . My teachers and friends are very helpful too, they always give advice on how we can make improvements.’
