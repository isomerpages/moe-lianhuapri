## Purposes of Cool Science Club

At Cool Science Club, our members are encouraged to be curious about their world. We want them to ask why things happen and find out how things work. As good scientists, we learn to make observations, ask questions and do research work in the process of searching for the answers to the many questions we encounter in our daily lives. By doing research and gathering evidence through experiments, we also learn how to communicate our findings through data and results. We hope to continue to cultivate our membersâ€™ abilities to make contributions and positively impact the community around them.

Members go beyond what they have learnt in the textbooks and classrooms. They get to explore and discover the nature around them. Besides learning more about the flora and fauna around them, we also expose our members to plant tissue culture.
