## Purposes of CCA

Robotics Club provides opportunities for students to pursue their interests and passion in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). It also provides them with a platform for innovation and creativity beyond the normal Primary School Science and Mathematics syllabus.

Robotics Club is an excellent avenue for pupils to engage in meaningful and active learning, build their character and 21st Century Skills such as innovative thinking and effective communication and collaboration. Members participate actively in interactive competition platforms with designable and programmable robots. Members cooperated with each other in teams and competed in competitions like Singapore VEX Robotics Championship, Singapore VRC National Championship and National Robotics Competition.

Members undergo training to help them develop and deepen their understanding of the mechanics of robot design and movement which strengthens their analytical and creative thinking skills. Members also develop their logical thinking and refine their programming skills as they continue to gain exposure when they learn to design and program using various programming platforms.

## Experiences

#### Robot Design & Mechanics

Members creatively design and build robots and mechanisms in their teams. Members have opportunities to showcase and share about their robots and designs.

#### VEX Robotics Competitions

Members participated and competed in various competitions. They develop problem solving skills, leadership capabilities and team spirit as they work together towards common goals. Members exercise self-discipline as they set goals and keep to the timeline in the preparation for competitions, persevere and strive for excellence.
