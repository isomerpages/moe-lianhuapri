## Purposes of CCA

Robotics Club provides opportunities for students to pursue their interests and passion in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). It also provides them with a platform for innovation and creativity beyond the normal Primary School Science and Mathematics syllabus.

Robotics Club is an excellent avenue for pupils to engage in meaningful and active learning, build their character and 21st Century Skills such as innovative thinking and effective communication and collaboration. Members participate actively in interactive competition platforms with designable and programmable robots. Members cooperated with each other in teams and competed in competitions like Singapore VEX Robotics Championship, Singapore VRC National Championship and National Robotics Competition.

Members undergo training to help them develop and deepen their understanding of the mechanics of robot design and movement which strengthens their analytical and creative thinking skills. Members also develop their logical thinking and refine their programming skills as they continue to gain exposure when they learn to design and program using various programming platforms.


## Experiences

#### Robot Design &amp; Mechanics

Members creatively design and build robots and mechanisms in their teams. Members have opportunities to showcase and share about their robots and designs.

**DAYAN SOH Primary 5 2021**

It was a fruitful experience working with my peers and racking our brains to solve a problem. This experience is not only beneficial to our future, but is also a good experience of being in a competition. It allows me to have an idea of what I might expect to face in other similar competitions, further boosting the chances of me learning more about robotics programming. Finally, it allows me to strengthen the bonds between my friends and me.

  

**MEGHNA RAJESH PRABHU Primary 4 2021**

I love coding. When I code, I often feel as if I am on cloud nine. Robotics has always fascinated me. Robotics involves mathematics, science and computer science, which I love. I encourage people who love these three subjects to join Robotics. You will love it.

  

**ANIKA NAIR RAMESH Primary 4 2021**

I have experienced a wonderful 2 years in the robotics CCA. It has helped me improve my problem solving skills. It has also given me a chance to explore deeply about robots. The teachers are helpful and supportive. They have helped me a lot through my process of learning. After attending the NRC competition on 7 September 2021 l became richer in knowledge. All I would like to say is that for me personally l have thoroughly enjoyed my 2 years in the Robotics CCA.
