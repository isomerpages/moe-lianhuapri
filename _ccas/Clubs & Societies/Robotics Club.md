#### Purposes of CCA


Robotics Club provides opportunities for students to pursue their interests and passion in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). It serves as a platform for innovation and creativity beyond the normal Primary School Science and Mathematics syllabus.

The club is an excellent avenue for pupils to engage in meaningful and active learning, building their character and 21st Century Skills such as innovative thinking, effective communication and collaboration. Members participate actively in prestigious competitions including the FIRST LEGO League and National Robotics Competition, where they showcase their skills through designable and programmable robots.

Members undergo comprehensive training to develop and deepen their understanding of robot design and movement mechanics, strengthening their analytical and creative thinking skills. Through various programming platforms, they develop logical thinking and refine their programming capabilities. The competitive element of participating in FIRST LEGO League and National Robotics Competition provides valuable exposure and real-world application of their skills, challenging them to solve complex problems while working in teams.




#### Experiences

##### KUBO platform to engage young learners

KUBO is an innovative educational robotics solution designed specifically for Primary 3 and younger learners, introducing coding concepts through a unique hands-on, screen-free approach. At its core, KUBO uses TagTile programming pieces that connect like puzzle pieces, allowing students to create physical paths for the robot to follow. This tactile method transforms abstract coding concepts into concrete, visible actions that young learners can easily understand.

The learning journey begins with simple movement commands, where students explore basic directional concepts like forward, backward, left, and right movements. As they grow more confident, they progress to understanding functions and loops by creating repeatable routes. This naturally evolves into problem-solving activities where students tackle challenges such as completing mazes and planning efficient routes. When routes don't work as intended, students learn valuable debugging skills by identifying and correcting errors in their sequences.

##### National Robotics Competition

The National Robotics Competition provides upper primary students with an immersive learning experience in advanced robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime kits. Students begin with fundamental robot construction, mastering mechanical concepts like gear ratios and structural design, while learning to integrate various sensors including colour, ultrasonic, and touch sensors for enhanced robot functionality.

Students develop their coding expertise using SPIKE Prime's intuitive programming interface, advancing from basic movement sequences to complex algorithms with sensor-based decision-making. The competition format challenges them to solve specific missions, requiring them to apply mathematical concepts and develop efficient programming solutions. Through team-based preparation and competition participation, students not only enhance their technical capabilities but also develop crucial skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and strategic thinking. This hands-on experience with SPIKE Prime technology provides students with a strong foundation in robotics and computational thinking, preparing them for future technological challenges.

##### First Lego League

FIRST LEGO League (FLL) uniquely combines robotics education with strong emphasis on Core Values, making it more than just a technical competition. While students learn to build and program autonomous robots using LEGO SPIKE Prime to solve complex missions, the heart of FLL lies in its Core Values: Discovery, Innovation, Impact, Inclusion, Teamwork, and Fun.

Students learn that friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals, embracing the spirit of 'Gracious Professionalism' and 'Coopertition'. Through team collaboration, they discover that helping one another is the foundation of success. Whether they're working on robot missions or developing innovative solutions for real-world problems in their research project, students learn to respect their teammates and competitors alike, celebrate diversity of ideas, and share their experiences with others. This balanced approach ensures that while students develop technical skills, they also grow into well-rounded individuals who understand the importance of ethical behaviour and positive collaboration in achieving success.

##### App development - Swift Explorers 2023 @ Crescent Girls

Students learn app development using Swift Playgrounds at Crescent Girls School to create wellness-focused applications, My Feelings App. Students develop basic app interfaces and functions while learning fundamental coding concepts in Swift, including variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. They learn to create user-friendly interfaces that allow for simple emotional check-ins while ensuring user privacy and confidentiality.

The focus is on creating a supportive tool that helps the school community. Students learn not just coding skills, but also the responsibility that comes with handling sensitive information and the importance of user privacy in app development.


##### DSTA-DSO-VJC Robotics Challenge

The DSTA-DSO-VJC Robotics Challenge engages upper primary students in advanced robotics engineering through defence science-inspired missions. Using LEGO SPIKE Prime, students design and program autonomous robots to complete complex challenges that often simulate real-world scenarios. The competition emphasises sophisticated programming skills, sensor integration, and strategic problem-solving. Students learn to develop precise movement controls and complex algorithms while working within specific competition parameters. This unique platform not only builds technical expertise but also provides valuable exposure to practical applications of robotics in defence technology, helping students understand how engineering solutions can address real-world challenges.

#### Students’ Voices

It was a fruitful experience working with my peers and racking our brains to solve a problem. This experience is not only beneficial to our future, but is also a good experience of being in a competition. It allows me to have an idea of what I might expect to face in other similar competitions, further boosting the chances of me learning more about robotics programming. Finally, it allows me to strengthen the bonds between my friends and me.

I love coding. When I code, I often feel as if I am on cloud nine. Robotics has always fascinated me. Robotics involves mathematics, science and computer science, which I love. I encourage people who love these three subjects to join Robotics. You will love it.

  <p align="right">MEGHNA RAJESH PRABHU Primary 4 2021</p>

I have experienced a wonderful 2 years in the robotics CCA. It has helped me improve my problem solving skills. It has also given me a chance to explore deeply about robots. The teachers are helpful and supportive. They have helped me a lot through my process of learning. After attending the NRC competition on 7 September 2021 l became richer in knowledge. All I would like to say is that for me personally l have thoroughly enjoyed my 2 years in the Robotics CCA.
