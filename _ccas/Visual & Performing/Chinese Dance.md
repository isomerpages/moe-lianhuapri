## **Purposes of CCA**

**Objective**

The Lianhua Chinese Dance has been around for about 20 years and aims to provide a tactile-kinesthetic experience for students to be engaged in fun dance training and to promote learning in a creative way. An appreciation for the aesthetics helps students understand the cultural significance behind cultural dances and elements. Students also develop better motor skills and showmanship through dance and movements.

**Purpose** <br>

培养学生从小喜欢舞蹈，对舞蹈保持热忱，做个负责任，培养坚持不放弃的精神。  
1. To foster a deep interest and life-long appreciation for Chinese dance.  
2. To develop in our students the school values of Diligence, Unity and Resilience.

**Mission**<br>

提升学生的舞蹈技巧以及鉴赏舞蹈能力。  
We aim to challenge our dancers with varied dance techniques and different dance forms for them to attain greater heights of performance.

## **Competition**

The Lianhua Chinese Dance has regularly participated in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) – Arts Presentation For Dance (Chinese). To date, the Lianhua Chinese Dance has achieved good results at the SYF Dance competitions.

In 2020, due to Covid-19 outbreak, the Singapore Youth Festival was cancelled. Our members were disappointed as they had prepared and practised diligently for it. Nonetheless, it had been a good learning experience for all.

## **Students’ Voices**

When I first joined Chinese Dance, I was shy and I seldom talked to anyone. I was glad that the Chinese Dance teachers-in-charge made me feel comfortable. They were friendly and sometimes funny. The students were also very kind and made me feel welcome when I was around.

You might wonder why I was passionate about Chinese dance. I was impressed by the dancers who had performed so gracefully during my kindergarten’s school event when I was 5 year old. It inspired me to join the Chinese Dance CCA when I entered Primary School.

I have been in the Chinese dance CCA for almost 3 years. Through the practices, I learn about teamwork. I also learn about resilience as I put in hard work for my dream. I always feel happy at the end of every performance!
