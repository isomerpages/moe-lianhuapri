#### Purposes of CCA

**Objective**

The Lianhua Chinese Dance has been around for about 20 years and aims to provide a tactile-kinesthetic experience for students to be engaged in fun dance training and to promote learning in a creative way. An appreciation for the aesthetics helps students understand the cultural significance behind cultural dances and elements. Students also develop better motor skills and showmanship through dance and movements.

**Purpose**

培养学生从小喜欢舞蹈，对舞蹈保持热忱，做个负责任，培养坚持不放弃的精神。

*   To foster a deep interest and life-long appreciation for Chinese dance.
*   To develop in our students the school values of Diligence, Unity and Resilience.


**Mission**

提升学生的舞蹈技巧以及鉴赏舞蹈能力。

We aim to challenge our dancers with varied dance techniques and different dance forms for them to attain greater heights of performance.

In 2024, our Chinese Dance was invited to perform as part of the Bukit Gombak Mid-Autmn Festival 2024 Celebration in conjunction with PassionArts Festival at Bukit Gombak Stadium. Our members put up a splendid and joyful performance for the Bukit Gombak residents. They certainly charmed the audience with their graceful moves and vibrant and dazzling costumes.

#### Competition

The Lianhua Chinese Dance has regularly participated in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) – Arts Presentation For Dance (Chinese). To date, the Lianhua Chinese Dance has achieved good results at the SYF Arts Presentations. 

In 2020, due to Covid-19 outbreak, the Singapore Youth Festival was cancelled. 

In 2022, our members have the chance to present a vibrant and vivacious dance titled《织锦姑娘》in SYF Arts Presentations. We are proud of our dancers, who despite the odds, had displayed much resilience and excellence as they strove to perfect their dance movements.

In 2024, our Chinese Dance had been awarded with the Certificate of Accomplishment for their outstanding performance. The performers presented a graceful performance titled “Bamboo Ballet in the Breeze”. Set amidst a serene bamboo forest, where the gentle breeze whispers through lush green leaves and sways tall bamboo stalks in a harmonious rhythm after a peaceful rain, this dance beautifully captures the essence of nature through expressive movements. Throughout this SYF journey, our students embraced the values of resilience, unity, and discipline, which greatly contributed to their growth as performers.

#### Students’ Voices

During this experience, I felt a mix of satisfaction, happiness, and exhaustion. It taught me the importance of perseverance and giving our utmost effort. I believe we demonstrated resilience and unity, as we persevered and collaborated as a team until the conclusion of the dance. I am deeply grateful to my teachers and teammates for their support and encouragement, which helped me confront stage fright and try new things. Overall, my SYF AP experience was enriching and fulfilling.

I cultivated a deeper understanding of unity and resilience through my experiences. During practices, I embraced feedback and diligently worked to rectify every minor mistake, striving for continuous improvement. Although I initially felt shy during our first school performance, each subsequent performance bolstered my confidence and allowed me to grow.
