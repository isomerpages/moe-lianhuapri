## **Purposes of CCA**

The Lianhua Chinese Dance has been around for about 20 years and aims to provide a tactile-kinesthetic experience for students to be engaged in fun dance training and to promote learning in a creative way. An appreciation for the aesthetics helps students understand the cultural significance behind cultural dances and elements. Students also develop better motor skills and showmanship through dance and movements.


Purpose:   
培养学生从小喜欢舞蹈，对舞蹈保持热忱，做个负责任，培养坚持不放弃的精神。   
1\. To foster a deep interest and life-long appreciation for Chinese dance.   
2\. To develop in our students the school values of Diligence, Unity and Resilience.

Mission:   
提升学生的舞蹈技巧以及鉴赏舞蹈能力。   
We aim to challenge our dancers with varied dance techniques and different dance forms for them to attain greater heights of performance.

## **Experiences**

Members have been given opportunities to display their talents through various school concerts and community events held by the Grassroots Organisation (e.g. Chinese New Year celebrations) and competitions.

In 2019, our members took part in a school concert, A Musical Treasure Hunt in The Land of Stories, where they put up a beautiful rendition of Wizard of Oz in the form of Chinese Dance. They certainly charmed the audience with their graceful moves and vibrant and dazzling costumes.

## **Competition**

The Lianhua Chinese Dance has regularly participated in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) – Arts Presentation For Dance (Chinese). To date, the Lianhua Chinese Dance has achieved good results at the SYF Dance competitions.

In 2020, due to Covid-19 outbreak, the Singapore Youth Festival was cancelled. Our members were disappointed as they had prepared and practised diligently for it. Nonetheless, it had been a good learning experience for all.

**<center>Students’ Voices</center>**

**Celine Pok - P4 Compassion**

When I first joined Chinese Dance, I was shy and I seldom talked to anyone. I was glad that the Chinese Dance teachers-in-charge made me feel comfortable. They were friendly and sometimes funny. The students were also very kind and made me feel welcome when I was around.

You might wonder why I was passionate about Chinese dance. I was impressed by the dancers who had performed so gracefully during my kindergarten’s school event when I was 5 year old. It inspired me to join the Chinese Dance CCA when I entered Primary School.

I have been in the Chinese dance CCA for almost 3 years. Through the practices, I learn about teamwork. I also learn about resilience as I put in hard work for my dream. I always feel happy at the end of every performance!

**Ashlyn - P6 Compassion**

I joined Chinese Dance when I was in Primary One. I enjoyed the CCA as I had a passion for dancing. The CCA teachers are very friendly and I learnt a lot of different dancing skills from the coach. When I knew that I was selected as the vice-chairman of the dance group, I could not contain my excitement and I knew it was all worth it.

I participated in the SYF twice. The experience was great. The performances made me overcome my stage fright. Besides participating in SYF, I also participated in the Lianhua Singing Festival. That was also a good experience for me.

Through these 6 years, I learnt to be resilient and diligent. I never gave up even though things didn't work out as planned. When I could not understand or had difficulty learning the dance movements, I would always ask the teachers or my peers and they would help me without qualms.
