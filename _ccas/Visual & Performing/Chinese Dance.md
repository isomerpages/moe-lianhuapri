## Purposes of CCA

The Lianhua Chinese Dance has been around for about 20 years and aims to provide a tactile-kinesthetic experience for students to be engaged in fun dance training and to promote learning in a creative way. An appreciation for the aesthetics helps students understand the cultural significance behind cultural dances and elements. Students also develop better motor skills and showmanship through dance and movements.


Purpose:   
培养学生从小喜欢舞蹈，对舞蹈保持热忱，做个负责任，培养坚持不放弃的精神。   
1\. To foster a deep interest and life-long appreciation for Chinese dance.   
2\. To develop in our students the school values of Diligence, Unity and Resilience.

Mission:   
提升学生的舞蹈技巧以及鉴赏舞蹈能力。   
We aim to challenge our dancers with varied dance techniques and different dance forms for them to attain greater heights of performance.

## Experiences

Members have been given opportunities to display their talents through various school concerts and community events held by the Grassroots Organisation (e.g. Chinese New Year celebrations) and competitions.
