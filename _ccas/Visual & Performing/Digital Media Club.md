### Experience

The Lianhua Digital Media Club was established in 2015 to inspire appreciation for the beauty we see around us every day. Taking photographs allows us to express ourselves in a creative manner. It also offers the chance to capture memorable moments. Members are exposed to elements of photo-taking and video-taking. They are given ample opportunities to put their learning into practice, both in and out of school. We encourage students to explore and discover new things in their surroundings through photography. Students learn to develop a keen eye for details as they start viewing the world around them through the lens.

### Opportunities

 Members are involved during school events and also participate in competitions such as “Our School, Our Stories”. They capture precious moments and can look forward to having their photos published in the school yearbook and school website.

Members are provided with opportunities through various organized activities to hone their observation, analytical, evaluative and communicative skills, while enhancing their love for the aesthetic. While learning to conduct independent research, they are also taught presentation skills and using the support of technology in photography. The club emphasizes three key values of our school—self-discipline, excellence and resilience, which we believe are the cornerstones of success.
