The Lianhua Digital Media Club was established in 2015 to inspire appreciation for the beauty we see around us every day. Taking photographs allows us to express ourselves in a creative manner. It also offers the chance to capture memorable moments. Members are exposed to elements of photo-taking and given ample opportunities to put their learning into practice, both in and out of school. Through photography, students learn to notice details as they start viewing the world around them through the eyes of a photographer.

  

Members are involved during school events and also participate in competitions to capture moments and can look forward to having their photos published in the club's editorial and school website.

  

Members are provided with opportunities through various organized activities to hone their observation, analytical, evaluative and communicative skills, while enhancing their love for the aesthetic. While learning to conduct independent research, they are also taught presentation skills and using the support of technology in photography. The club emphasizes three key values of our schoolâ€”self-discipline, excellence and resilience, which we believe are the cornerstones of success.
