#### Purposes of CCA

##### Experience

Lianhua is fortunate to be surrounded by beauty as we are nestled in the neighbourhood of the Little Guilin. The Lianhua Digital Media Club was thus established in 2015 to better appreciate the beauty of our surroundings. Members are exposed to elements of photo-taking and video-taking. Through photography, our members express themselves creatively and are able to capture memorable moments. Our members are given ample opportunities to put their learning into practice, both in and out of school. We encourage students to explore and discover new things in their surroundings through photography. Students learn to develop a keen eye for details as they start viewing the world around them through the lens.

##### Opportunities

Members are involved in our school events and also participate in competitions such as “Our School, Our Stories”. They capture precious moments and can look forward to having their photos published in the school yearbook, official facebook page and our school website.

Members are provided with opportunities through various organized activities to hone their observation, analytical, evaluative and communication skills, while enhancing their love for the aesthetic. While learning to conduct independent research, they are also taught presentation skills with the support of technology in photography. The club emphasizes three key values of our school—self-discipline, excellence and resilience, which we believe are the cornerstones of success.
