The Lianhua Handbell Ensemble was established in 2013 and was named the “Griffin Bellz”.

  

Being one of the youngest Performing Arts CCA in Lianhua Primary School, Griffin Bellz has worked diligently to spread the magic of music through the rhythmic movement of handbells. Training sessions have allowed the students to develop close friendships and a strong team spirit. Values like resilience and confidence are inculcated in each member as they persevere to perform their very best.

  

The Griffin Bellz achieved the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2014 for their performance of ‘Greensleeves’ and ‘Part of Your World’ under the baton of Mr Mak Sheng Hong Myren.

  

Those who love music have happy hearts. Griffin Bellz will continue its pursuit to bring joy to everyone with its resounding and mellifluous music.

## Students' Voices

“I am really glad to be in Handbells as it not only provides us with the opportunity to learn hard skills like identifying notes, reading musical scores but also soft skills like learning how to communicate with friends from different levels, having the compassion to teach the juniors and unity in counting on one another to present a beautiful piece of music to the audience. Most importantly, I made a lot of friends whom I could laugh and share my experiences with.”

“Handbells is an amazing CCA. Every song that you play with your handbell members is melodious. Handbells made me learn the values of resilience and teamwork. I find all the sessions enjoyable no matter how tiring it may sometimes get. All the handbell members are very cheerful and friendly. Anyone who joins handbells will never regret the decision.” &nbsp;

“I have been in Handbells for the past four years. The SYF was very exciting. It has taught me not to give up and to be resilient. I enjoy and appreciate the time our instructor puts in to teach us the techniques to ring the bells.”

 <p style="text-align: right"> Isabel Foo<br></p>  

“During our handbell practice, I have learnt values like unity, resilience, diligence, self-discipline and loyalty. When I was in Primary Three, I was very lost when I just joined the handbell club. I did not know how to ring the bells and chimes. In addition, I could not even read the notes on the score. Thankfully, with my instructor’s and seniors’ guidance, I overcame my difficulties and learnt how to play the notes. I must also thank my teachers and fellow club members for guiding me along. I really enjoy the handbell practices!”&nbsp;

 <p style="text-align: right">Lauryn Kuah<br></p>  

“During my time in Handbells, I have not only learnt about music, but also the meaning of unity and resilience. All of us have to work together in Handbells. Without teamwork, the whole song will be messed up. I also learnt not to give up. Ever since I joined Handbells, my seniors have taught me how to play the chimes, ring the bells and identify the notes. Over time, I started to be able to play the notes on my own. Some may think that Handbells is merely about the simple ringing of bells. There are actually different techniques to produce the sound from the bells such as plucking and damping. If you have a passion for melodious and classical music, this CCA could just be meant for you!”
