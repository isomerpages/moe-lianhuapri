# Indian Dance

![](/images/CCAs/Indian%20Dance/photo1.jpeg)

The Lianhua Indian Dance has been a part of the Performing Arts for about 20 years. It aims to inculcate the love and appreciation for the Indian dance forms.

It also aims to develop dance skills among students from diverse racial groups and at the same time, allow students to express themselves gracefully through classical, folk and contemporary dance movements. It fosters values such as self discipline, unity, resilience, diligence and compassion as students are challenged with various dance techniques and forms.

## Major Programmes

Performances and competitions are great platforms for our dancers to showcase their capabilities and strengths in the performing arts. Students are exposed to National Competitions such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) every two years. They are also given the opportunity to perform in school events (e.g. Deepavali and Prize Giving Ceremony) and public events organized by external organizations (e.g. Grassroots Organization).

#### Collaboration with Community

**Mid-Autumn Celebration**

Students are provided with opportunities to perform at Grassroots events yearly. Students have performed at Mid-Autumn events and other community events. Students train and perform with zeal. They enthralled the audience at public events with their agile and graceful movements.

The love for Indian Dance has influenced our students to continue with this passion in their post-primary education. Indian Dance CCA is definitely a CCA which any child could join to have fun and at the same time, acquire a beautiful and ancient art form experience.

In this SYF journey, I have learnt :
Teamwork - It is not just with one person working , with one person working the performance will look bad , but with everyone's&nbsp; cooperation the dance will will look even more beautiful and graceful.

Perserverance - It is not giving up and&nbsp;persistence in doing something despite difficulty . We have to keep practicing , inorder to get it right and gracefully .

My experience is a sad yet amazing adventure. I like my instructor and the dance is very good. I learned a lot in my past years in Indian Dance. Most importantly I learned the values of diligence, resilience, excellence, and importantly unity. &nbsp;I have learnt teamwork is very important in group performances. My team worked very hard to give or best. Sadly at the last moment I could not perform due to covid but I watched the dancers online.&nbsp; We worked hard and gave our best. I have new experiences giving me amazing memories. I am still sad I could not contribute in SYF but I know I will get another oppurtunity. Thank you to my instructor and teachers who gave us support and encouragement!I am very proud to be in Indian Dance.

We have been throuh a lot of practice sessions and struggles practicing for Singapore Youth Festival(SYF). The first few lessons were awesome, since we did not do much dance moves and we were talking a lot! There were not enough Dance Members in our group and only 13 were chosen for SYF as we joined first. A few weeks after we joined a lot of P2s' joined us. We were done with almost half the song, so we did not include any of them. A girl named Priya went to India when we were starting to learn the rest of the song. Mdm Yati our dance teacher also gave us some snacks to motivate us. FINALLY THE DAY OF SYF CAME! We all were super excited and nervous...it was the day, I thought many people will come, but to my surprise there were only a few people. I remembered they can watch online. I gave all my best and WE DID IT! My teacher then promised me that she will give us a treat! It was a memorable day for me.
