#### Purposes of CCA

Indian dance integrates play-based learning methods, allowing students to explore dance in a fun and interactive way. This involves improvisation, games, and group activities that encourage creative expression and help students connect with dance on a personal level. Through various dance performances, workshops, and cultural exchanges, students gain real-world experiences. These hands-on opportunities help them understand the significance of Indian dance forms in different cultural contexts. They may also engage in collaborative projects with peers, enhancing their teamwork and social skills. These experiences deepen their appreciation of the art form and offer a platform to showcase their growth. Dance is not just about technique but also about overcoming physical and mental challenges. Students may face challenges related to mastering complex choreography, coordinating with a group, or managing stage fright. The program encourages them to embrace these challenges with resilience, fostering problem-solving skills, perseverance, and self-discipline. 

Over time, they learn to adapt to difficulties and grow more confident in their abilities.  Beyond physical development, Indian dance promotes emotional, mental, and social growth. Students gain confidence, self-expression, and empathy as they learn to communicate emotions and stories through movement. The discipline required in Indian dance also encourages focus and time management. As they progress, they build a strong sense of accomplishment, learn the value of hard work, and develop a deep respect for their cultural heritage.

In summary, the Indian dance provides a well-rounded experience that combines play, real-life experiences, challenges, and personal growth. It helps students not only master dance but also cultivate valuable life skills, enhancing their overall development.


#### Collaboration with Community

Performances and competitions are great platforms for our dancers to showcase their capabilities and strengths in the performing arts. Students are exposed to National Competitions such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) every two years. They are also given the opportunity to perform in school events (e.g. Deepavali and Prize Giving Ceremony) and public events organized by external organizations (e.g. Grassroots Organization).

**Mid-Autumn Celebration**

Students are provided with opportunities to perform at Grassroots events yearly. Students have performed at Mid-Autumn events, Chingay @ Heartlands 2025 Event (Chua Chu Kang GRC and Hong Kah North SMC)  and other community events. Students train and perform with zeal. They enthralled the audience at public events with their agile and graceful movements.

The love for Indian Dance has influenced our students to continue with this passion in their post-primary education. Indian Dance CCA is definitely a CCA which any child could join to have fun and at the same time, acquire a beautiful and ancient art form experience. In 2024, our Indian Dance was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment for their captivating performance in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation For Dance (Indian). 

The dance, titled "Sakthi, The Energy Within," beautifully embodies the theme of female empowerment and the innate strength that every woman possesses. It celebrates the multifaceted nature of femininity, showcasing aspects such as strength, compassion, gentleness, and resilience.

This journey proved to be both challenging and immensely rewarding for our students as they committed themselves to mastering new steps and finishing the choreography.

Participating in SYF brings me lots of joy because I love to dance, and the song we performed is my personal favorite. This connection to the music makes the dance even more special for me. While I feel a sense of sadness about leaving my CCA this year, I treasure the bond I share with my CCA members and will miss them dearly. I look forward to reuniting with them for dance after my PSLE. SYF provides me the opportunity to follow my passion and dancing brings me so much happiness, and I believe it resonates with the audience.
