## Purpose of CCA

Malay Dance CCA in Lianhua Primary school aims to create an awareness in the cultural aspect of Malay Dance among students regardless of language and racial background. Here, students’ interest in performing arts can be developed and stretched, underpinned by the school values of Self-discipline, Resilience and Excellence. We believe that all students can achieve success in the interest they choose. At the end of their primary school years, our dancers would have gone through the experience of performing in and out of school and at least gone through one SYF competition. Our dancers also learn the importance of giving to the community through external performances.

## Experiences(in school)

Malay dance students performed in Lianhua’s first ever outside school production, A Musical Treasure Hunt In the Land of Stories which was held in Dulwich College on 13 April 2019. The performers presented their items with open and fearless hearts which impressed the audience. Their dedication and passion towards the dance amazed everyone with their energy, enthusiasm and commitment.

## Competition

The Singapore Youth Festival competition is a much awaited event for our dancers. This is a bi-annual competition organized by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the achievements of youths in their co-curricular activities. It is usually held in April although preparations for the competition start as early as November in the previous year. Dancers are selected based on their readiness and the skills mastered for the choreographed dance.
