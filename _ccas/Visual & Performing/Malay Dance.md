#### Purpose of CCA

Malay Dance CCA aims to create an awareness in the cultural aspect of Malay Dance among students regardless of language and racial background. Students’ interest in performing arts can be developed and stretched, underpinned by the school values of Discipline, Resilience and Excellence.  At the end of their primary school years, our dancers would have gone through the experience of performing in and out of school and at least gone through one SYF competition. Our dancers also learn the importance of giving to the community through external performances.

#### Collaboration with the community

Our Malay Dancers performed for the Bukit Gombak Mid-Autumn Celebrations.  It was a wonderful and meaningful experience for the dancers.

#### Competition
The Singapore Youth Festival competition is a much awaited event for our dancers. This is a bi-annual competition organized by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the achievements of youths in their co-curricular activities. It is usually held in April although preparations for the competition start as early as Term 4 of the previous year. Dancers are selected based on their readiness and the skills mastered for the choreographed dance.

#### Students’ Voices

Practicing for SYF was not easy.The many ups and downs that we experienced together all paid off. I feel very proud of all the Malay Dancers. Although some dancers fell back along the way, we managed to learn our new positions fast enough. We also had to balance the extended training sessions with our studies. On the actual day, we felt very nervous but once we set our foot on stage, we felt that the time we had to perform was not enough. We wanted to go back on stage and perform again! It was a very fun experience. This CCA has taught me to be resilient. We may forget our dance steps along the way but we know that we can always get help.

I feel really happy and proud that I was given the chance to join in this journey. I think my parents are proud of me. It was hard at first but after many practices, we finally did it! I am so glad I have the Malay Dance teachers who comfort and help us when we are down. They are our shoulder to cry on. There were times when I felt shy but after a while, I managed to overcome it and kept on dancing. My dance team members did well too! Our teachers are very proud of us.
