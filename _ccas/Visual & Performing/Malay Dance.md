# Malay Dance

## Purpose of CCA

Malay Dance CCA aims to create an awareness in the cultural aspect of Malay Dance among students regardless of language and racial background. Students’ interest in performing arts can be developed and stretched, underpinned by the school values of Self-discipline, Resilience and Excellence.&nbsp; At the end of their primary school years, our dancers would have gone through the experience of performing in and out of school and at least gone through one SYF competition. Our dancers also learn the importance of giving to the community through external performances.

## Competition

The Singapore Youth Festival competition is a much awaited event for our dancers. This is a bi-annual competition organized by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the achievements of youths in their co-curricular activities. It is usually held in April although preparations for the competition start as early as November in the previous year. Dancers are selected based on their readiness and the skills mastered for the choreographed dance.



## Collaboration with the community

**In 2022, our Malay Dancers performed for the Bukit Gombak Mid-Autumn Celebrations.&nbsp; It was a wonderful and fruitful experience for the dancers.**

## Students’ Voices

My SYF journey was a very memorable one. At the start of the year, I struggled to balance my study and my CCA. But overtime, I managed to balance both of them.&nbsp; It was my first time experiencing performing to strangers.&nbsp; I was only used to performing for my school. My experience has taught me to be resilient and disciplined.&nbsp; I hope to be able to experience this again in secondary school.

My experience in the SYF journey was unforgettable.&nbsp; I had an enjoyable time with my friends in the CCA.&nbsp; At first, before the performance, I was really nervous as it was my first time performing for SYF but when I got on the stage, I was having fun.&nbsp; After the performance, I remembered talking to my friends on how I wanted to perform again on stage. &nbsp; There were so many people clapping for us. Overall, it was a day that I would always remember and I hope to experience it again in secondary school.
