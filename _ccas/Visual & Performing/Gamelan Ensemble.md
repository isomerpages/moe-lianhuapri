#### Purposes of CCA

Lianhua Gamelan Ensemble has been around in the school for more than two decades. The Gamelan members’ journey starts with the commitment to enjoy and develop the skills needed to play the instruments. The students do not need to have any prior or basic musical knowledge or experience in playing the instruments, but must have perseverance, resilience and also the willingness to learn to play different instruments. Our instruments such as Gong Agong, Saron, Peking, Bonang, Demung, Gender, Kethuk, Kendhang, Kenong, Ceng ceng, Slenthem, are played in synergy to produce a captivating performance that represented the joy and confidence of our Lianhua spirit. 

**What Students Will Learn:**
* Basic techniques of playing Gamelan instruments
* Rhythmic coordination and ensemble playing
* Cultural significance and history of Gamelan music
* Performance skills for school and external events

#### Collaboration with Community

Our Gamelan CCA goes beyond the classroom, engaging with the wider community to promote cultural appreciation and inclusivity.

**2024**

Lianhua's Gamelan Ensemble performed at the prestigious 2024 Rotary International Convention on 25 May 2024 at Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre, showcasing their talent on an international stage. They presented three musical pieces—Bima Kurda, Gunung Ganang, and Kandapat—to a diverse and influential audience. This opportunity highlighted their dedication, promoted cultural exchange, and reinforced global unity. We are incredibly proud of our students and look forward to more opportunities for them to inspire and connect through Gamelan music.

**2023**

In February 2023, we were honoured to be invited to perform for Club HEAL’s 10th Gala Dinner where Mdm President’s Halimah Yaakob is the Patron-in-Chief. Our students were thrilled to have met and engaged our Head of State in a short conversation.

**2022**

Our Gamelan Ensemble also gave an invigorating showcase of three pieces that they had been practicing since the beginning of 2022 during the Singapore Youth Festival in 2022 – “Eling-Eling”, “Jaranan” and “Play It Easy”, playfully referred to by our members as “PIE”.
