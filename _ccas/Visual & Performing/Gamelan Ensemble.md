# Gamelan Ensemble

Gamelan CCA has been around in the school for more than 20 years. The gamelan member’s journey starts with the commitment to enjoy and develop the skills needed to play a few of the instruments. The students do not need to have any prior or basic musical knowledge or experience in playing the instruments but must have perseverance and resilient and also the willingness to learn to play the different instruments.

Through the weekly practice sessions and performance opportunities (both in school during special events and external performances) given to the members, pupils enjoy and take a deeper interest in the gamelan history and instruments.

The CCA aims to generate greater appreciation of the Javanese/ Balinese music and rhythms by creating and performing work which are unique and progressive, thus giving the audiences a new experience and perspective of the gamelan music

Pupils are given opportunities to express themselves through the music, particularly using the different instruments, and to inculcate in them the school values of teamwork, discipline, resilience and responsibility. Pupils with good characters are chosen to take up leadership roles in which they learn to be more disciplined and become more confident in themselves.

The students have participated in the Singapore Youth Festivals many times and have been invited to put up performances in special school events and also various external platforms, receiving an overwhelming applause from the audience.

In 2019, the 3 teachers-in-charge of Gamelan were interviewed by Mr Trisno, a CNA reporter about the perspective of the teachers-in-charge of the Gamelan Ensemble, its challenges and rewards in running the CCA.

  

The members performed for Lianhua’s first ever school production, A Musical Treasure Hunt In the Land of Stories which was held in Dulwich College on 13 April 2019. They provided live accompaniment to part of the performance with a few members taking part in part of the production too. Their performance and and passion towards the live accompaniment to the production amazed everyone with their synergy, enthusiasm and commitment.

  

Early this year, four primary 4 pupils, MARISSA BINTE MUNIR, SOE SU MYAT MON GANIA, GRACIELLE PRIKANZA ALPHAERA NAINGGOLAN & RAJARAJAN RAJARAJESWARI were interviewed for the second season of I Kid You Not, a video series that profiles young artists traditional Asian art forms, produced by Esplanade. The objectives of the series were to enthuse and inspire young people to find out more about traditional arts, demonstrate the relevance of the traditional arts to young lives and to show how the traditional arts is an avenue to discover the world at large, develop values and appreciate tradition.

  

We were very happy as the 4 pupils brought pride to the school name for being featured in the video.

  

Currently, we have members from Primary One to Primary Six.

  

Below are some reflections by our members:

  

I am always passionate about traditional ensemble music. In learning Gamelan, I can learn and play more than one instruments. In order to understand Gamelan, it is necessary to know what and how each instrument contribute to the overall sound. When all the instruments are played together, they give an unforgettable sound and experience.

  

Usually after school, I feel stressed. When I am stressed, it usually takes a long time for me to overcome it. When I go for the sessions, Gamelan music makes me feel more relaxed. It reduces my stress. I can learn more about Gamelan and the types of songs that are played.

Example: wedding music etc.

  

Gamelan has taught me teamwork and co-ordination. As Gamelan has to be played together with many performers, co-ordination is vital. During Gamelan sessions, I work with my friends and we always co-ordinate to produce great music. Gamelan has also taught me about hardwork. This is especially so before any staged performances, we practice more frequently and never give up until we achieve the desired performance.

  

I really like the music, as the music calms me down and relaxes me. All my stress are relieved whenever I hear the music of the Gamelan instruments.

I keep on going for my CCA because of my friends. Gamelan is always fun. I always look forward to every training session.

  

Gamelan has taught me to be patient. When a member need the instructor's help, the other members have to practice their instruments by themselves. I also learnt about teamwork. Teamwork is needed in Gamelan as we have to hear one another or else the music will sound bad.
