#### Purposes of CCA

Lianhua Gamelan Ensemble has been around in the school for more than two decades. The Gamelan members’ journey starts with the commitment to enjoy and develop the skills needed to play the instruments. The students do not need to have any prior or basic musical knowledge or experience in playing the instruments, but must have perseverance, resilience and also the willingness to learn to play different instruments. Our instruments such as Gong Agong, Saron, Peking, Bonang, Demung, Gender, Kethuk, Kendhang, Kenong, Ceng ceng, Slenthem, are played in synergy to produce a captivating performance that represented the joy and confidence of our Lianhua spirit. 

**What Students Will Learn:**
* Basic techniques of playing Gamelan instruments
* Rhythmic coordination and ensemble playing
* Cultural significance and history of Gamelan music
* Performance skills for school and external events

#### Collaboration with Community

Our Gamelan CCA goes beyond the classroom, engaging with the wider community to promote cultural appreciation and inclusivity.

**2024**

Lianhua's Gamelan Ensemble performed at the prestigious 2024 Rotary International Convention on 25 May 2024 at Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre, showcasing their talent on an international stage. They presented three musical pieces—Bima Kurda, Gunung Ganang, and Kandapat—to a diverse and influential audience. This opportunity highlighted their dedication, promoted cultural exchange, and reinforced global unity. We are incredibly proud of our students and look forward to more opportunities for them to inspire and connect through Gamelan music.

**2023**

In February 2023, we were honoured to be invited to perform for Club HEAL’s 10th Gala Dinner where Mdm President’s Halimah Yaakob is the Patron-in-Chief. Our students were thrilled to have met and engaged our Head of State in a short conversation.

**2022 and 2024**

Our Gamelan Ensemble also gave an invigorating showcase of three pieces that they had been practicing since the beginning of 2022 during the Singapore Youth Festival in 2022 – “Eling-Eling”, “Jaranan” and “Play It Easy”, playfully referred to by our members as “PIE”. In September 2022, our Second Minister for Education, Dr Maliki Bin Osman visited Lianhua where he and our School Leaders tried their hand at some of our Gamelan instruments for a segment of “PIE”. Under the confident tutelage of our Gamelan Chairperson, Marissa Bte Munir (6R), and Vice-Chairperson, Soe Su Myat Mon Gania (6H), and with the careful guidance of another four of our experienced Gamelan members, they indeed “Played It Easy” right alongside our students.

In the 2024 Singapore Youth Festival, our Gamelan Ensemble showcase two pieces. Their first piece, "Bimå Kurdå," took the audience on a journey of courage and resilience. It commenced with a majestic opening that evoked themes of bravery and fortitude. In contrast, the second piece, inspired by Balinese philosophy as "Kandapat" meaning "4 siblings," celebrated unity and harmony.

#### Students’ Voices

During my experience with SYF, I faced various challenges that tested my abilities. I encountered situations where I had to adjust to new and sometimes uncomfortable circumstances. One challenge was learning to play two instruments simultaneously and memorizing all the necessary information. However, with the support of my friends and teachers, I was able to overcome these obstacles. I know I will miss the camaraderie of the Gamelan Ensemble team and the sense of accomplishment that came with overcoming challenges as I prepare to graduate from Lianhua Primary School. My SYF journey has been rewarding, and I eagerly anticipate future performances, such as the one at SOTA.

I learnt from the SYF experience that performing is not just about showcasing our talents, but to also enjoy the moment on stage with my ensemble. Our ensemble showed teamwork, resilience, diligence, and excellence during our SYF. We worked as a team, never gave up, worked hard, and did our best during our SYF performance. I am happy that I could get another opportunity to perform at SYF Arts Presentation with my ensemble before my graduation.

When I first joined Gamelan, I watched my older classmates play confidently, and I thought it would be easy. But when it was my turn, I made many mistakes. I felt frustrated, but my teacher encouraged me to keep trying. I practiced hard, and one day, I finally succeeded. Since then, I remind myself never to give up. I am glad that I joined Gamelan.

I felt happy and excited, but I was still scared that I might mess something up. My team and I had worked together to ensure the songs sound polished and seamless.  I would love to participate in SYF again as it is fun and being able to represent the school. I learnt how to be more discipline, resilience and unity when playing gamelan.

During our SYF practice sessions, I showed resilience by never giving up, even when I made mistakes with the notes or melody. When I first received the notes for our songs, I felt excited to see how they would come together. I am thrilled to have the chance to participate in SYF again this year.
