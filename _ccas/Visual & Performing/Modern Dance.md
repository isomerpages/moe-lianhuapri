#### Competition

**Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2024, 2022 and 2020 **

The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is an annual event organised by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the achievements of our youths in their co-curricular activities (CCAs). Starting in March and culminating in a month-long celebration in July, the SYF will engage students from schools across Singapore involved in the performing arts, sports and uniformed group CCAs.

More than 30,000 students are expected to participate in the performances and activities in the SYF as well as events leading up to the SYF. The SYF reflects MOE’s belief in the importance of a well-rounded education.

Lianhua Primary School’s Modern dancers performed in the SYF in March 2022. All participating schools achieved the Participation Award for the SYF 2022. They also prepared an item for the SYF 2020. Unfortunately, the SYF 2020 was cancelled due to the Covid-19 situation in 2020. Nonetheless, we are very proud of the commitment and efforts that our Modern dancers have put in for both years. In 2024 SYF AP, our Modern Dance achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment. Their piece, titled "How are you treasuring your time?" explored the perpetual motion of time, reminding us to cherish each moment. Time, a precious gift, encourages us to embrace the present and strive for a brighter future. Throughout this SYF journey, our students improved their ability to balance studies and extracurricular activities.

#### Students' Voices

I joined Modern Dance CCA because I love to dance. I did a video during Passion Project showing my passion in dance when I as in Primary 1.

When I first started my CCA in Primary 2, I felt that the warm-up steps were very difficult. I almost give up. But after few days, the dance training become more fun, I had the opportunity to join in SYF and it really made me happy.

My most memorable experience in Modern Dance is when I was getting ready to go to SYF. I was very shy because I never performed at any stage. I feared standing in front of so many audiences. But when I remembered I had my parents, teachers, and friends there to support me, I overcome my fear. It was a very memorable SYF day.

I have been a member of modern dance since July 2022.&nbsp; It has been a great experience thus far. I particularly enjoy Modern Dance as I can learn many different dance styles through the CCA. In addition, there are many opportunities for me to perform in and outside of school. One of my most unforgettable experiences would be my performance out of school. Although I was very nervous, I did my best to put up an amazing performance for the members of the public. If you like dancing, then I am certain that Modern Dance is the CCA for you!&nbsp;

I joined Modern dance because I enjoy dancing to music. My sister was also a great influence. I used to watch her dancing and I grew to love dancing. One of my most memorable experiences in Modern Dance was when I participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) in 2022. I represented my school with my CCA mates in this nationwide festival. It was a very memorable and proud moment for me. I also had the opportunity to watch and learn from other schools’ performances in SYF. It really was a marvelous experience.**
