#### Purposes of CCA

The Lianhua Art Club provides budding artists with a platform to explore and nurture their creativity through a variety of 2D and 3D art forms. With a wide range of visual art media and techniques, students hone their artistic skills while fostering collaboration and building self-confidence.

Beyond the classroom, students deepen their appreciation for the arts by engaging with their environment and contributing their artworks to the broader community. Through these experiences, they develop both as artists and individuals.

#### Collaboration with Community

**Chingay 2025 National Education (NE) Programme - Joyous ART-Venture!**

Lianhua Primary School’s Art Club is proud to be part of a dynamic group of 2,000 students from eight schools and institutions, selected to co-create art installations featured at the Chingay Parade 2025! This initiative is part of our school’s community outreach collaboration with the People’s Association’s (PA) Community Arts &amp; Culture Club, as part of the Chingay 2025 National Education (NE) Programme - Joyous ART-Venture. Through this collaboration, our Art Club students had the unique opportunity to develop 21st Century Competencies (21CC), enhancing their teamwork, creativity, and critical thinking as they worked together to bring their artistic visions to life.

#### Students’ Voices

I feel that taking part in the Chingay Art Installation was an incredibly memorable experience. I am also very proud and satisfied because our installation artwork turned out beautifully, and we dedicated a lot of time and effort to it. Throughout the process, I became more comfortable communicating with others, and by the end of the experience, my self-confidence had grown.

"When I did my SYF art work with my team members, I displayed the value of resilience as I overcame challenges I faced. The journey was fun and it was the first time I used posca markers to draw short repeated lines on a shrinkable plastic just like the artwork by Vincent Van Gogh, Starry Night. I am proud of myself for all the efforts put in. I think our art work is beautiful."
