### Purpose of Art Club

The Lianhua Art Club aims to provide opportunities for budding artists to explore their creativity through 2D and 3D art in an array of visual art media and forms. Students develop their artistic skills, learn to work collaboratively with others, and build self-confidence.&nbsp;
  
Members have participated in and clinched awards at various competitions. They share their passion with the school and the community at large to promote the beauty of Art. Exploration also extends beyond the classroom setting, where students develop a deeper appreciation for the Arts through engagements with the surroundings as well contributing their art work to the community.

## **Students’ Voices**

"When I did my SYF art work with my team members, I displayed the value of resilience as I overcame challenges I faced. The journey was fun and it was the first time I used posca markers to draw short repeated lines on a shrinkable plastic just like the artwork by Vincent Van Gogh, Starry Night. I am proud of myself for all the efforts put in. I think our art work is beautiful."

"It was a wonderful experience as I learned new painting techniques and art skills in my art making process. I learned that if we work together in unity, we can support and learn from one another in the journey to achieve our common goal.&nbsp; I felt that our SYF artwork is very meaningful as it can raise awareness in people not to waste food and to only buy the amount of food needed. I am very happy to be part of the SYF art team and I love our artwork."

"The SYF art activity was so fun as I got to work with the P5 and P6 friends and we all got along well. I put my art skills to good use and acquired new skills as we learned metal embossing. We embossed images representing our emotions and things associated with COVID on small metallic pieces which we pieced together to form our beautiful globe. I have become more resilient and have learnt never to give up in face of challenges. Together with my friends, I have learned unity as we learned and worked together as a team to complete our artwork. I felt happy and proud that we have created a masterpiece and I hope everyone will also appreciate our artwork and effort."

"Being in the SYF Art Club team was extremely fun and exciting. I am very proud that I was chosen to be part of the team. In this journey, it was enjoyable working with my friends and teachers, and I made new friends as well. Through this experience, it has taught everyone the value of resilience and unity as we thought we could not finish the art work in time however, we persevered on and work together as a team and even created an additional mini globe. I am proud of our unique and beautiful artwork, which is a dedication to everyone who have emerged stronger and more resilient after the COVID.&nbsp;&nbsp;

"As the team leader in my group, I feel happy about collaborating with my other team members, brainstorming sessions while experiencing the art-making process. I get to experience different art processes using different materials that I have not used before. It was so exciting and enriching."
