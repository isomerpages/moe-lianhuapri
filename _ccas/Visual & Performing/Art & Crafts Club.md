<center>Our Art Club session in progress.</center>

The Lianhua Art Club aims to provide opportunities for budding artists to explore creativity through 2D and 3D art in an array of visual art media and forms. Members have participated and clinched awards in various competitions (e.g. Singapore Youth Art Festival 2021. Our Category A artwork received the Special Mention Award. They share their passion with the school and the community at large to promote the beauty of Art. Exploration also extends beyond the classroom setting, where students develop a deeper appreciation for the Arts through engagements with the surroundings as well contributing their art work to the community through PAssionArts collaboration for this year's National Day celebration creating Nagomi Art.

## SYF 2021

**<u>Singapore Youth Festival 2021</u>**

Our school participated in the SYF Art competition this year and submitted artwork for three categories. It is our great pleasure to announce that our category A artwork clinched the Special Mention Award. Students and teachers in the group worked hand in hand to create the 3-Dimensional Artwork that captured the judges’ attention. Based on the theme, “No Tech No life” our students experienced using different materials to create a beautiful sculpture. Well done!
