<p>The Percussion Ensemble was set up in 2018. To lay a strong foundation for the students, the beginners will focus on the rhythmic exercises, practising the correct techniques of using a pair of drumsticks to hit on a practice pad. Members will get to play percussion instruments like the Bass Drum, Tom Toms, Drum set, Timpani, Xylophone, Marimba and Glockenspiel once they have acquired the drumming skills.</p>

<p>Through the learning and performance of percussion instruments, students have been inculcated with values such as Self-discipline, Unity, Diligence, Resilience, Compassion and Excellence. They have also acquired music literacy and developed a sense of appreciation in percussion music through their learning journey.</p>

## **Students' Voices**

I started learning to play the Chimes last year. I encountered difficulties at the beginning as I had to practise many, many times to memorise the notes of a music piece. This year, I also learned to play the Marimba. I made many mistakes at first. However, after practising for many times, I felt confident and was excited to perform. Looking back, my teammates and I had put in a lot of our time and effort practising for the SYF pieces. It was a great experience for me, and I was proud of myself.

Through this CCA, I have learned to play musical instruments like the Marimba and Xylophone. I am also able to practise the rhythmic exercises on the practice pad. I have a better sense of understanding music and rhythms. Through the various training sessions, I have acquired values like ‘self-discipline’, ‘unity’, ‘diligence’ and ‘resilience’.

Through this fruitful and exciting journey, I have learned to be resilient because no matter how many mistakes I have made, I must try to play the music piece accurately and hopefully correctly. This CCA has lifted my understanding and appreciation of music to a higher level. I want to cherish all the moments together with my teammates. We will strive hard and put in our best during our performance.

This SYF journey is a memorable experience for me. I learned to play the percussion instruments like the Tom Toms and Bongos, besides the Marimba and Vibraphone that I was usually playing. I also had a deeper understanding of reading the scores. Being resilient had played a big part in this journey. I did not give up and practised even harder. The value of ‘unity’ had taught me to work together with my teammates and play the pieces well. I had a lot of fun during my training as well as making friends.

Through this SYF journey, I have learned the importance of ‘resilience’ and ‘unity’. I have come to realise that I am not only learning to play my part, but I also need to be familiar with other teammates’ parts so that we can blend in and play well as a group.
