The Percussion Ensemble was set up in 2018. To lay a strong foundation for the students, the beginners will focus on the rhythmic exercises, practising the correct techniques of using a pair of drumsticks to hit on a practice pad. Members will get to play percussion instruments like the Bass Drum, Tom Toms, Drum set, Timpani, Xylophone, Marimba and Glockenspiel once they have acquired the drumming skills.

  

Through the learning and performance of percussion instruments, students have been inculcated with our school’s core values such as Self-discipline, Unity, Diligence, Resilience, Compassion and Excellence. They have also acquired music literacy and developed a sense of appreciation in percussion music through their learning journey.
