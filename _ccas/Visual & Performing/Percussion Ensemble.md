#### Purposes of CCA

The Percussion Ensemble was established in 2018 with the goal of building a solid foundation for students interested in percussion music. Beginners start by focusing on rhythmic exercises and learning the correct techniques for using drumsticks on a practice pad, ensuring they master the basics before moving on to more complex skills. As students progress, they have the opportunity to play a variety of percussion instruments, including the Bass Drum, Tom Toms, Drum Set, Timpani, Xylophone, Marimba, and Glockenspiel, allowing them to explore the full range of percussion.

Throughout their learning journey, students are not only taught technical skills but also important values such as self-discipline, unity, diligence, resilience, compassion, and excellence. These qualities are fostered through both individual practice and group performances. Additionally, students acquire music literacy and a deep sense of appreciation for percussion music, enriching their overall musical experience and broadening their understanding of rhythm and melody.

#### Students' Voices

From this CCA, I have learnt to play instruments like Marimba, Xylophone and the Tambourine. I found it difficult to play the instruments at first as I could not understand most of the notes written on the scores. After multiple practices and with determination, I could understand more notes and play the instruments better. Now I know how to play better, I feel more confident and look forward to more performances.

When I first joined this CCA, I was scared and anxious as I had to take part in performances. I had very little confidence in performing then. I learnt to collaborate with other members to work on many pieces of music. I learnt that working in a group is very important to succeed. I remembered being very stressed about the SYF performance. We were very happy to receive the Distinction Award. I am thankful to my training instructor for guiding me whenever I have difficulty in rhythm. My future goal is to master all the instruments in the ensemble. I will continue learning music beyond the CCA as this is my interest and passion.

When I was in Primary 2, I did not know how to play an instrument and could not read the scores. I improved my skills as the years went by. I gained confidence through performing at the SYF-AP and other events. Working together is important as the song will not sound good if we do not play together. We were awarded a Distinction for our SYF performance. Through our practices and performances, I learnt Resilience, Unity, Self-discipline and Diligence. I chose Percussion because when I was 5 years old, I wanted to play instruments. I will continue to pursue music beyond the CCA because I would like to be a singer and compose music. I believe I can use some of the useful skills I have learnt in this CCA.

Being in Percussion CCA was a great experience as I learnt to play different instruments throughout the years. Although I major in playing the drum, I was given the opportunity to play the marimba and the vibraphone too. Being the CCA leader of Percussion, I did my best to be a role model to the juniors. One of our challenges – a big one – was to master the piece titled “ Big Dipper” for SYF-AP and we were awarded a Distinction! But now, I, along with other P6 friends, will be graduating soon. I hope for the best for the Percussion CCA. It has been a wonderful experience.
