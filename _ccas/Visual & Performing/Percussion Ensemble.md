The Percussion Ensemble was set up in 2018. To lay a strong foundation for the students, the beginners will focus on the rhythmic exercises, practising the correct techniques of using a pair of drumsticks to hit on a practice pad. Members will get to play percussion instruments like the Bass Drum, Tom Toms, Drum set, Timpani, Xylophone, Marimba and Glockenspiel once they have acquired the drumming skills.

Through the learning and performance of percussion instruments, students have been inculcated with values such as Self-discipline, Unity, Diligence, Resilience, Compassion and Excellence. They have also acquired music literacy and developed a sense of appreciation in percussion music through their learning journey.

## **Students' Voices**

I have joined the Percussion Ensemble CCA for almost four years. I have learned to play instruments like Timpani, Xylophone and Bongos. I have also learned to exercise self-discipline, to perform in unity as an ensemble, to be resilient and diligent in order to achieve excellence during my training. I would like to thank my seniors for helping and guiding me.

In this Percussion Ensemble CCA, not only do we need to play the notes correctly, we have to keep to a steady beat and look at the conductor to ensure that the music is played well. I have learned the importance of Teamwork. I have also learned to value friendship as we have gone through the numerous practice sessions together to perform for the SYF Arts Presentation.

Initially, I joined the Percussion Ensemble as I loved music and would like to learn how to play musical instruments. This CCA has helped me to understand music notes better and play as a group. I have learned to be resilient and diligent because no matter how many mistakes I make, I must try to play well. Now with the SYF Arts Presentation, I know I must practise even harder as I do not want to let my entire ensemble down and all my hard work go to waste. We will strive hard to excel in our performance.

I really enjoyed this SYF journey. I enjoyed the weekly training very much and also the chance that we get to play the percussion instruments like the Marimba, Vibraphone, Xylohone and Timpani. I had acquired the values of Diligence – to work hard on the instruments that we play; Unity – to work together on our music piece and Resilience – to never give up no matter how tough the training was.
