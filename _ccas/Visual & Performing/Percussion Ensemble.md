The Percussion Ensemble was set up in 2018. To lay a strong foundation for the students, the beginners will focus on the rhythmic exercises, practising the correct techniques of using a pair of drumsticks to hit on a practice pad. Members will get to play percussion instruments like the Bass Drum, Tom Toms, Drum set, Timpani, Xylophone, Marimba and Glockenspiel once they have acquired the drumming skills.

  

Through the learning and performance of percussion instruments, students have been inculcated with our school’s core values such as Self-discipline, Unity, Diligence, Resilience, Compassion and Excellence. They have also acquired music literacy and developed a sense of appreciation in percussion music through their learning journey.

## **Students' Voices**

Initially, I was confused as to how to play with the mallets as I only knew how to play the piano. But over time, I learned to use the mallets to play the Marimba and Xylophone. I should say I am good at playing the instruments now.

I have learnt to be patient when practising on the drum pad, as I had to take baby steps to master the drumming skills. Besides the friendly and helpful training instructor, I was grateful to my friend as well, who was always by my side to help me during our training sessions.

I always look forward to the training sessions because it is fun playing the Marimba and practising on the drum pad. Although it could be tough learning to play the pieces, I had fun learning together with my friends. Our training instructor will explain to us in simple terms.

I had a lot of fun playing the Marimba, Bass Drum and Drum Set together with my friends. I had also learned more about the musical terms and concepts and I enjoyed the training sessions very much.

I have learned to read musical notes and play a variety of instruments like the Bass Drum, Drums and Marimba. I have also exhibited values such as Resilience and Excellence by never giving up and playing the instruments to the best of my ability.
