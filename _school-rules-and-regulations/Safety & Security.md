# Safety & Security

1\.  AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES

Parents/Guardians will be informed of their children’s after school activities via our communications app, Parents Gateway. Parental consent is required for students to stay in school for lesson after school hours or for school outings. Consent can be given via Parents Gateway. Hardcopy of notifications will be given only to parents/guardians who have made prior arrangements with the school.

  

If the school does not receive any consent from the parents/guardians before the start of any school activities, the student will not be allowed to take part in the activity.

  

2\.  VISITING THE SCHOOL

Parents/Guardians who wish to come into the school to visit the General Office Staff or their children are to obtain a pass from the security guard before they proceed to the General Office for further assistance. Students will meet their parents in the General Office. Visiting of teachers are solely by appointment only.

**Emergency Evacuation Plan**

In times of crisis, your safety is our prime concern. All classes would have to be evacuated in the shortest time possible to an area of study. Your teachers would be assuming other duties once your classes are safely evacuated.

  

You can help by familiarising yourself with the designated evacuation route and taking part in our school evacuation drill seriously. Disruptive behaviour during the drill or initiating fire alarm without cause will result in severe disciplinary action.

  

Once the evacuation alarm goes off

*   Stop all activities and keep quiet.
*   Do not panic.
*   Listen and pay attention to the announcement.
*   Switch off all electrical fittings in the classroom.
*   Line up in 2 lines outside the classroom. DO NOT take anything with you.
*   Close the classroom doors.

During evacuation

*   Proceed quickly to the assembly area in an orderly manner using the designated evacuation route.
*   Do not attempt anything that will endanger your life, for example, putting out the fire.
*   Do not take the life. Use the stairs.
*   Do not run back to your classroom to look for your missing classmates.

At the assembly area

*   Wait quietly for your teacher to take attendance.
*   Do not try to look for your classmates if you discover any of them missing.
*   Inform the teachers around if you notice that your classmate is not with you.
*   Listen and pay attention to any instructions given by the teachers.
*   Follow all instructions given.

  

**Lightning Warning System**

When the school’s lightning warning system is activated, all outdoor activities are to stop immediately. All students and staff are to proceed calmly into the sheltered areas.
