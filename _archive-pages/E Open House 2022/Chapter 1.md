Here in Lianhua, we offer various programmes to inculcate the joy of learning in our students. Students learn through play by exploring, discovering and sharing their knowledge! Read on to find out more about our programmes!


**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

Students are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences in four domains: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. Students also learn socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision making. PAL nurtures confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills in students.

**Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to help students connect academic knowledge and skills with the real world. ALP allows students to appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic arena. It also develops computational skills in students, facilitates studentsâ€™ learning and application of design thinking, and fosters joy in learning and minds of inquiry.

At Lianhua Primary School, our focus is on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), particularly in the area of sustainability. Every Lianhuarean will go through ALP from Primary 1 to 5.
